A Midrange phone from oneplus. why I choose this phone is only because of the brand value we have more other option like Vivo t1 / realme 9 /9 Pro / Oppo/ Motorola but the oneplus has their own premium feel the reason why I have given only four star.......1). The Amoled display is not there but it is not important.2) The wide angle lens is also not there.3) they have removed alert slider. Otherwise the phone is perfect I am satisfied with this device 95% you can definitely go for it. the important thing is that red cable is available which is a signature of oneplus mobile also the oxygen OS is perfect I like it and it's give extremely performance that fill you like a { Makhan Malai }.Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•,Positive
"Bought in big billion day sale but towards the end. My experience is when Amazon takes time in delivering a product, it will be worth it because they push bad product line in starting and immediate delivery. Gifted my mother (58years), and for an elderly person, this phone is perfect.I was initially confused whether to buy this then went for it after reading reviews that its good for elderly person.I setup the phone before giving to my mother. And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand. Super fluid, battery, camera, features.Although I would not recommend this phone for youngsters, but its ok if you want a budget power filled smartphone.",Positive
"I was searching a smartphone in 25-30k segment checked lot of phones but could not find a good phone with on screen FPS and dedicated sim/MC slot suddenly I checked on google that 1+ is also launching the phones with these features and then I watched an unboxing video and decided to buy this phone the brightness of the display and battery should be more good so it will be definitely more awesome but as per performance and brand of 1+ phone is good in 23000 (including cards discount) the antutu is about to 5lac when the antutu of iphone 12 (Rs 42k cost) is 6.25 lac so this deal is not bad, but if you are planing to buy so just check the phone at the showroom or on ytube.",Positive
"*Battery life is decent, if you're a heavy user you'll get a backup of 12-15hrs after 100% charge.But as I'm not a heavy user I'm getting a backup of more than 24 hrs.*Camera is also good, night mode is working good if you have a good light, if not you'll not get satisfaction.*The main issue of this phone is brightness. If you're keeping your brightness level at the lowest then you won't be able to see things properly in the night also.And outdoor you have to keep the brightness high.Which will affect your battery backup.*TIll now I have faced only one issue, which is brightness. But rest all are working fine.",Positive
"After the six months of use i would like to say it is a very good phone in this price range but within 6 month of use i am facing few problems like sometime many apps like Paytm, phonepe etc gets crashed as it is opened the contacts are not able to save as well as you cannot make calls sometimes as this app also gets crashing i have noticed this to OnePlus care also but they are clueless hope they'll soon give a update and able to fix this major problem as i don't want to do hard reset.",Positive
"First things first, this is the phone who very easily beats any redmi phone camera in this price range. So we should ignore reviews of redmi agents.Rest arePros :Clean UI,fast processing,fast charging 65 watts,display is very good,sound quality is goodCons:Back panel is plastic",Positive
If u are not a game addict then this phone is for uhh game like bgmi nd all......battery lyf is superb.... something it slow down during online payment other than that ig does not hang,Positive
Bought this phone for my Dad who wanted to chuck away his redmi note 7. He is not a gamer and wanted a phone that doesn't hung or pop some odd instructions during UPI or credit card payments or any transactions whatsoever.  Oxygen OS is light and very user friendly. No confusions at all unlike mini for the elderly.,Positive

Overall satisfied with the product quality and performance. Good product under this price range. The battery charging is fast and the battery backup easily lasts for a whole day with normal use ( didn't try playing heavy games),Positive

"I am writing this review after using 5 Days this phone & 1.5 Month use of Motorola Moto G62.Performance, Camera, Battery Life, functionality of this phone is more & far Better than Moto G62.Pros.  Performance, Battery, Camera, Fast Charging (0-100% Charging in 1 hours & 10 Minutes (this is real data after charging 3 times after purchasing)).Cons.  No Measure Cons.  1- Just Price is Little higher.  2-Just some Software functions like Small Menu Apps Grid (Matrix) Bar, Font Style & Small Font Size looking like Large(That should have to be smaller than given.  There should have to option for the reduction of Small Apps Grid (Matrix) Size.",Positive

¬†Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",Positive

¬†First time finger print reader not work but after that istam work well done",Positive
"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.Severely disappointed.",Positive
Phone performance under this budget is surprising Amazing. But the finger print reader don't work properly i have added 2 fingerprints of my own but still it don't work for half of the time . If I talk about camera so if you want to capture anything outdoor then just go for it without any doubt but it don't give satisfaction in indoor clicking. Other photos performance is much better in indoor case but for outdoor it'just wowwww .It's charges really fast and stays for long .,Positive

"Bought this phone at 22K inr. So consider this price for my review.Camera is hit and miss. Sometime it takes amazing shot, sometimes it just fumbles.EIS with 1080p60 is amazing. You will capture more videos than expected.UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in thatBattery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones.",Positive

I have been using this mobile from last 5 months i would say this is best budget phone in 25K. The best and important features of this 65W changer you don't need to worry about charging your mobile it's like blink and you will find your mobile charged in 30 minutes of time.,Positive

¬†To give you a gist of the review, overall, the phone is 9.5/10.I'll talk about the specifics in this detailed review which shall give you the complete detailed aspect of the phone.1. DisplayThe display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.2. Processor & RamI have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.3. BatteryYour phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.4. CameraI don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.The front camera is quite good.5. Design & BodyThere is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.6. Operating SystemLoved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it.",Positive
Writing this review after using the mbl for 3 months.ProsPhone lookwise goodGood battery lifeLight weight and slimFast chargingCons1.The biggest con is its processor. Not happy with Mediatek processor and it's true that snapdragon is better than Mediatek.Processor is slow and you will feel it after using the mbl.2. Camera is just averageConclusion: One plus is loosing its glory and I don't recommend this one to buy in this range.,Positive

¬†I am editing the review what I am facing in day to day task , using the phone since 3 months :Pros:1. Performance is superb, didn't feel any lag or bug yet.( ***Edition: YouTube unexpectedly closing 2-3 times repeatedly in 1 day , that may be bug which I faced recently)2. OS & Software: Got 2 security updates & 1 Android update ( Android 11 to 12 next day after purchasing the phone)3. Battery Charging : 40-45 min approx.4. Battery Drain: 1 day for moderate user ( WhatsApp, Insta, YouTube, Online Classes etc.)5. Gaming Performance: don't play any games so look some other's review.6. Camera: Superb in day light, descent in low light.7. Speaker: Single speaker is loud enough for your entertainment.8. Refresh Rate : for day to day task, 90 Hz r.r is smooth enough to perform.9. Special Features: Pocket Mode (No accidental impression on screen when phone is in your pocket), Expernal Storage ( Most of brand neglect this), 3.5 mm jack.Cons:1. Accidental screenshot is captured due to Volume button. It should be placed on slightly upper portion. You may the face the problem whenever you lock the screen.(***Edition: You can turn off that features for screenshot in setting)2. Camera should be improved in low light.3. It must be upgraded upto Android 14.4. You can't record any call otherwise it will inform the person that you are recording the voice.Pro Tips: 1. Use ""Ultra Steady Mode"" to take video for your content/personal memory.2. Select 'Standard Refresh Rate' for better battery output.I will edit my review later if I face an issue regarding daily usage.",Positive

I got this mobile for ‚Çπ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ‚Çπ3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ‚Çπ20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.,Positive

"Biggest mistake was to order at Amazon. I myself went at Amazon depot to receive it because delivery boy was not ready to come at 6 pm. Return is most complicated in Amazon. They fixed appointment with technician yesterday and there is no call till now. Flipkart is best to handle quality issues...Amazon broke my trust this time...it's okay for shopping upto 500/-.Camera quality is average. Battery is 4500 only but good thing is charging is very fast. Back cover provided by oneplus is white coloured which masks the appearance of mobile.Moreover, i will use it not more than 6 months due to Camera quality.....which is a little disappointing if you have used Oppo..",Positive
"This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned. If you're someone like me, who wants to jump from the 10k range to a mid-range costing smartphone, I would suggest you go for it. My father and I bought the same phone model on the same day almost three months ago, both of us are not gamers or heavy users, but we prefer the smoothness of everyday workflow over everything else. So if you hate it when your phone takes an extended period of time to open up simple applications, you will love to upgrade to this. I had my apprehensions before buying because of the sceptical comments related to OnePlus dropping its quality, but frankly: I did not see a difference since I have never used a phone beyond the 20-25k price range. Spending more than this amount on a smartphone is just plain splurging in my opinion, especially for middle-class people like us.It does not have any apparent issues, if you take good care of it, I think it should probably last long.All in all, if you're looking for a no non-sense smartphone and think of a phone pragmatically and don't wish to delve into minute details, I would suggest going for this without any second thoughts.",Positive

Better than I expected. I don't know why people are giving negative reviews. But i love it. It's worth the price. It can be great if they added wide angle lens and 6000 mah battery instead of 5000.

OnePlus is pathetic about updates and after each update the phone gives some issues like internet issues battery drain and now after Android 12 the phone has become like oppo phone and the feel of oxygen OS is completely gone and the brand value of OnePlus will fade if they will continue like this and this is my review after 7 months of usageScreen 5/5Battery 2.5/5Build 3.5/5Overall the phone is average considering the price and features,Negative

But with moderate or more use it lasts about 10-12 hrs which is good enough.‚Ä¢camera - not quite great that is you wont expect this from oneplus but in this range I'll give it a solid 3/5.‚Ä¢ audio, video, wireless connectivity all seemed very smooth.‚Ä¢Design-wise it's not exactly premium looking but not totally badRest will again review after a month.",Positive

"I cannot praise this phone enough for such performance at this price range. I was considering yo buy iPhone SE but then I saw a OnePlus phone at 18,999 which was a bit odd to me. So I researched about the phone and turns out this is the best budget friendly phone you can buy!! Absolutely stunning camera, Oxygen OS optimises the apps to perfectly that background apps don't drain your battery. It charges fast and you can just charge it 30mins in the morning before you leave for college or work and it'd be at 100% . I'll be uploading a few pictures taken from this device just to show the camera's brilliance. At this price, I'd suggest that it's totally worth it to buy this OnePlus device and not go for other brands.",Positive

"Review after 10 days.It's a very good and practical phone if you are able to purchase it under 20k by applying coupons and exchange.Build : I like metal build but Ok with the plastic and Glass builds as well. This is very light and compact phone made by plastic back and frame.Display : 90 Hz is a sweet spot. Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box.",Positive

I am first time user of OnePlus mobile i bought this mobile on 1 May 2022 this is 3rd day I did not find any issue like heating or battery getting darinout soon I am not gamer still the phone is really awesome i would  really want to give geniune feedback.Oneplus Nord CE 2 is awesome phone. Before using OnePlus I have used Vivo 11 pro which is also one my best because of its 25mpix camera fast charging and battery life.Below are my ratings as per usagesFinger print reader 4/5Screen display 4/5Selfie camera 3/5Front main camera 4/5Battery life 4/5Phone body 4/5No phone heating issue,Positive
"Phone is good .. but when it comes to calling someone.. other person is unable to hear and you have to go in an open area so that the other person could hear . It is the major issue. Otherwise battery, camera quality is good",Positive

Thanku very much,Positive
This is a good phone. Easy of handling and battery life is good.,Positive
I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Battery üîã stays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camera üì∏ is not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.,Positive

Phone is average. Camera quality is average too(4*). I am using this phone since last two months. But in the software OnePlus need to improve. Like you could not able to know incoming during the calls (2*) and notification light is not available(0*). Notification sound is very low(2*). Charging is good (5*). Display (5*). Phone is clean by software (not must settings like oppo and Vivo).,Positive

Pros:-10/10 Very Light Weight So easy to grip.9/10 Phones design and UI design is good.10/10 Very Fast Charging takes 30 to 40 minutes to full charge.8/10 Camera quality is decent.9/10 Good for first time buyer.Cons:6/10Sometime found leg while swipe up  swipe down UI but ok.7/10 Found that you can't make dual app of some apps.,Positive
"Battery life is good, easily lasts a day for my usage, with frequent chat updates, some music playing, once or twice camera usage etc.Display quality, photo quality, sound quality are all above average.However, a bug that disappointed me is that the fingerprint sensor doesn't turn on even in always on display mode. And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now.",Negative

"I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period.",Positive

"Have been using this phone since the last one and half months and it's been going really fine although to say that I don't play any mobile games of any sort which is a kind of relief for any kind of phone.Although it's a rebranded version of Realme 9Pro Plus with mostly the same hardware and design but it's superior than the latter in most of the segment be it camera processing, display or processing power cause it has a refined software which is the OxygenOs and comes with a lot less bloatware than the latter.The only downgrade I felt in this phone is it's speaker which is a mono one and not the regular stereo one but it can get pretty loud but lacks smoothness and let me tell you the absence of a AMOLED screen is not a con cause although it lacks it but the blacks are blacker and it's relatively brighter even with a LCD panel and it gets pretty bright when outside or under the Sun otherwise all other components of the device works pretty well considering it's below 20k price tag.So, this was what I felt after using the device for one and half months.",Positive
Best phone in all segments but  1 issue finger senser week,Positive
Great battery life even at full use I can easily use it for 24 hrs and only take 1hr:20min to charge fully.Camera it not the best but we can take great photo using pro mode.Easy to use and refresh rate is also good.

"Actually the rating is three and half stars. Since there's no provision for half star so I've rated it Three! Especially recommended to those who haven't experienced the OnePlus' Oxygen OS so far. For the uninitiated, Oxygen OS provides the bloatware-free OS. Closer to near stock Android.  No spammy notifications like Xiaomi or even Samsung nowadays. Mostly bug-free. The interface is neat.Battery is awesome. Easily lasts whole day with moderate to heavy usage.Camera is just above average.Display is great though it's LCD. Since it's LCD so obviously there's no in-screen fingerprint scanner. It's embedded with physical power button. So people looking for in-screen fingerprint scanner might feel disappointed.Sometimes screen remains dark and unresponsive despite ringing which can be resolved with new S/W patch provided OP deems it worthy to address. Obviously it can't be compared with it's more expensive cousins but overall a nice big phone and the best in this price range. Definitely worth a try, especially if you haven't used Oxygen. For the rest, be adventurous, try something new if you can, otherwise it's always a safe bet.",Positive

It's been a month and phone is just ok... nothing great or good about it. I m bit worried that performance definitely worsen with passage of time. Many a times phone goes blank...no app to access. While playing games it's not at all good experience. My last phone was redmi note 8 pro and it was faaaaaar aheadof this phone in almost every aspect. The only good thing about this phone is that u can fully charge it in 35-40 minutes.,Positive
"So it's been about a week that I am using this phone and I don't regret buying it. Its 90 Hz refresh rate is so smooth. Got two security patch updates too in a week which is really a great thing.The camera is really good. The phone looks premium and is lightweight and slim. It feels good in hand.Even though the speaker is mono firing speaker and not stereo speakers, it really is very loud. The screen is beautiful and there's Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the front and back.Now, coming to the battery, it easily lasts a whole day and it charges real quick and you're ready to use it whole day (100% battery)after just 35-40 mins of charge.I do casual gaming (BGMI and COD) and I didn't find any lag or jitter. So no complain about that.So overall satisfied with this phone so far.",Positive

"I bought this phone during the Monsoon carnival. My budget was around 20k and I wanted to try OnePlus for the first time. After 20 days of usage, I feel the phone is genuinely good to use. The Screen Refresh rate is 120hz, pretty smooth and quick. Camera is decent as well, not the best of course but does the job tbh. Rest all features are good and one won't be dissatisfied. I'm super angry with Amazon's exchange service. I had requested an exchange for my old samsung device. I had an 4400 off the purchase price. But the delivery agent rejected the phone exchange. Phone is still working fine, it just had some scratch on the back due to wear and tear which is normal. But it was rejected and I had to pay the difference. Worst exchange service ever. Will never again order a phone from Amazon.",Positive

"Here are some important points that I noticed about the smartphone :1. Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 years warranty. Seems like company is pretty sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.I am thankful to the seller for providing me the phone in best condition and I thank Amazon for free and fast delivery.",Positive
"Phone is good, software & camera quality is also good but a minor problem is that the side panels of mobile phone are not scratche proof after using only 20 days i have small small tiny spots on side panel & the back side quality is also poor if you have your bike key & Mobile phone in same pocket then it can make scratches on back side , not happy at allüòë",Positive

"I have no point of comparison except for my older oppo A83(2018) model. Thats an older model and yet very much better than the new ONE PLUS.  I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.üòû DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full. Thats the only feature I love about it.",Positive

The only thing I didn't like is mirror back of phone as now a days better looking phones are available.,Positive

Camera is not that good as expected from ONE+ , photos in dark are good but not satisfied. If we zoom images, pixels get scattered and image quality falls.2.

As mentioned in other reviews this phone indeed has decent camera quality compared to other phones in this budget band. But I found other features that are unique to this phone mentioned below.1.

"The 6.59-inch LCD display comes with 1080√ó2412 pixels and 401 PPI pixel density. The phone offers a 20:9 aspect ratio and a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus has tried to balance it out with support for a 120Hz refresh rate display. But that doesn‚Äôt take the focus away from the display being dull from some of the rivals in the segment. Coming back to the display performance, the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G offers smooth animations, all thanks to the higher refresh rate. Mind you that the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G packs a higher refresh rate than what we get on the OnePlus Nord CE 2, which is a bit costly.We had a good time using the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G display as it supported HD content on popular OTT apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The panel is bright and offers swift colours. Though, we have to admit that it missed the punchiness of an AMOLED panel.Overall, it strikes a balance of an inferior panel and a fast refresh rate which should work well for most users in this price segment.",Positive

"It's just a Android phone with OnePlus branding. It came with lots of bugs. Camera also average not like anyone can expect from a OnePlus phone.Indisplay fingerprint and face lock are not fast as other brand phones.Charging is fast, but if you use a little bit while charging the speed will reduce automatically to 50watts. Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12. It's just one weeks of usage and there's a lot of issues don't know where to report.Thanks for reading. This is my honest review on this device.",Positive

"This was my first phone above 20k, and tbh, it's not bad. I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. It gets the job done fast, and comes with a boatload of features too.",Positive

"Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good. See attached photo taken from 5 th floor.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Netflix. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 yes warranty. Seems like company is preety sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.Best of luck Chinese company... Till the time India doesn't develop its own effective mobile, keep earning.

"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it.",Positive

I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is üëåüèªCons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting. Video get stuck and security and update patch is still not given.If you want to buy a phone for good use and want to use it for a long time. This is okay. But this is no where near to high gaming or photo fan phone",Positive

"I have ordered this item after doing lot of research for a good phone within my 25k budget. I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.",Positive

"I like the phone it's beenmore than 2 months aince I bought it. I have zero complaints about it. And tha camera, battery, sensors, gestures, fingerprint, face recognition almost all features are absolutely amazing wait proper response and working. And being a OnePlus product I guess this phone can run for atleast 4-6 years without any issues if maintained properly. Worth the money",Positive
"It is very good phone in this price range good camera quality, very good finger print reader overall very nice phone i would really recommend this phone",Positive
Perfect mobile,Positive
Phone is smooth. Gaming experience is fine.Camera is average. Night mode is below average.Battery drains very fast. Can last only 6-8hrs on continuous run. But has very good fast charging. U can completely charge in 45-60min.,Positive
"Good phone. But camera is average like 16000/- phone. Thay given mono speaker, in this price range we can get Dolby on other phone. Any way performance is good. Very fast like blink of your eyes. But much over priced. It should come in 22k to 23k range.",Positive
Good mid range mobile but on higher price range,Positive
Without using mobile battery decreased,Negative
Nice one with the budget,Positive
"This is a budget model and a lot of One Plus features are compromised in this model. The camera clarity is bad for the price we pay. Also, this model has some issue with the proximity sensor. One of cousins and I had purchased this phone during the launch offer. But both of us have the same issue with proximity sensor. Even if we lock the phone while in a call, the display turns on automatically with every small movement and will start dialling on it own which will make the listener uncomfortable (listening to the continuous tap on keys). Other than these two, I have not noticed any other issue. But I feel its not a model worthy of 20K",Negative
"Descent phone.Great Design.Batter and charging is very good.Display is awesome,90Hz is perfect.Processor in perfect regarding price.Better 5g connectivity, this phone has 8 5g bands means future protected.Disappointing thing is camera,less than average camera quality, with 24k price cameras should be much better.",Positive

Dont buy one plus guys worst phone and the que in the support store will take hours....I bought CE 2 one month prior i got display blotting problem the service centre asked me to pay 6400 though the phone was not damaged.....utterly crap please don't buy one plus ....useless phone no value for money..in case you buy the phone sell it immediately completely useless...and one plus is a problematic brand long ques in service centres of no help....guys please don't buy one plus go for Samsung the trustworthy brand....,Negative
"Each and everything about this phone is surprising what was truly more than expected was the charging I literall placed on charge at 9:00 @ 18% battery and after my breakfast @ 9:17 it was 81%, I was shocked and that lasted an ample amount of time in office, have left taking charger to office. Also the night charging is great the phone automatically optimises how fast to charge the mobile so that it reaches 100% at 6 in the morning.Happy till now with the purchase.Though there is a downside I hated the google phone and contact app I am badly missing the stock OnePlus apps, this is OnePlus not some android phone please don't use third party apps just be yourself you are gr8.",Positive
"This is an amazing phone for people looking at OnePlus brand to start with. I have previously owned One plus 2 and a One plus 5T and when I had to switch this time, I didn‚Äôt want to move away from OnePlus brand and spend too much money as well. I am a basic smartphone user and use this for basic browsing, social media, YouTube etc and this phone meets the performance bar. If you are looking for a good phone without making compromises on quality of components, camera etc, you can definitely consider this.",Positive

1. Camera quality is just average like 15-19K mobile phone. Doesn't seems like this is oneplus mobile phone camera. I have upgraded from Redmi Note 10 and felt very little improvement in camera.2. Performance is also just okay. I have used oneplus nord 2 which is just 4K expensive than Nord CE 2 but way more faster than this.3. Battery life is great. Charging time is same as mentioned.Overall it is just an okay phone. Nothing special. 4-5K expensive than what is actually offered hence it is overpriced or doesn't justify it's price.,Positive
Bettery life is very low one day bhi nahi chalti,Neutral

In hand field is good and software experience is nice without any bloatware. The Bahamas blue colour is exotic. Well optimised Ram management. Single speaker but is of good quality. Earpiece is loud and clear. Signal quality is good. Carrier aggregation is working fine. Haptic motor is good. Charger is simply amazing. 30 mins full charge.

Using since 2 days. No hanging issue faced so far and works absolutely smooth (I am not a gamer) . Camera might not be best in this class but still good. Macro camera just average. No bloatware. Almost Pure Android experience. Perfect crisp Display. I find it value for money at this price range.The case provided is of very inferior quality. Start turning yellow at the edges on the very first day. Better they would not have even provided this.PS: Will update my review in case I face any issue.,Positive

"Good mobile under best Budget, but camera quality is little down when compare to other OnePlus mobiles. Finger print sensor does not respond some times, and it's quite different from other normal mobile, loud speaker quality is also not satisfactory.",Positive
One plus didn't meet our expectation.  Battery drains faster than expected.  Lot of non-core features but VERY handy are not available.  Eg. Would like to see a tiny indicator while charging and the indicator turning green when it's ready.  Setting duration for silent mode turns the silent mode off at the end of the term.Phone calls are clear and so are the picture quality.,Positive
Dislike this camera,Neutral
In this price 1+ mobile is the best choose. Within 15 to 18 minutes battery was charge. More than 27 hours battery work with call video and games. All application is working smoothly with 6GB Memory.,Positive

"As a tech geek these are my experiences with this phone..1.Fingerprint scan is not smooth as compare to other low end phone also2. Due to omnivison camera, picture quality is not good in low light.. Okayish camera3. No inbuilt app for messages, dialer, recorder, notes.. All are google based apps4. MAJOR problem- It has google CALL RECORDER by default.. If you record during call ""it will prompt recording has started"" which can be heard to both caller and receiver.. I mean people use Call recorder for safety and secure purpose, but here it is opposite5. If you turn on WiFi hotspot for more than 10 15 minutes,it will start showing heating issue6. After software update, for twice my audio was not working, had to restart again7. Battery drains fast in ambient display mode..8. Did not find any difference in power saving mode aa compare to normal mode.. Battery drains in same speed in both mode..9. I mean its 2022, then why android 11?10..No stereo speakerFew pros :-Look wise its best.. Display is top notch.. Better than Oneplus CE.. 12bands 5g support.. comes with nfc..Few other issues are also there..",Positive
