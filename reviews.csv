A Midrange phone from oneplus. why I choose this phone is only because of the brand value we have more other option like Vivo t1 / realme 9 /9 Pro / Oppo/ Motorola but the oneplus has their own premium feel the reason why I have given only four star.......1). The Amoled display is not there but it is not important.2) The wide angle lens is also not there.3) they have removed alert slider. Otherwise the phone is perfect I am satisfied with this device 95% you can definitely go for it. the important thing is that red cable is available which is a signature of oneplus mobile also the oxygen OS is perfect I like it and it's give extremely performance that fill you like a { Makhan Malai }.Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
"Bought in big billion day sale but towards the end. My experience is when Amazon takes time in delivering a product, it will be worth it because they push bad product line in starting and immediate delivery. Gifted my mother (58years), and for an elderly person, this phone is perfect.I was initially confused whether to buy this then went for it after reading reviews that its good for elderly person.I setup the phone before giving to my mother. And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand. Super fluid, battery, camera, features.Although I would not recommend this phone for youngsters, but its ok if you want a budget power filled smartphone."
"I was searching a smartphone in 25-30k segment checked lot of phones but could not find a good phone with on screen FPS and dedicated sim/MC slot suddenly I checked on google that 1+ is also launching the phones with these features and then I watched an unboxing video and decided to buy this phone the brightness of the display and battery should be more good so it will be definitely more awesome but as per performance and brand of 1+ phone is good in 23000 (including cards discount) the antutu is about to 5lac when the antutu of iphone 12 (Rs 42k cost) is 6.25 lac so this deal is not bad, but if you are planing to buy so just check the phone at the showroom or on ytube."
"*Battery life is decent, if you're a heavy user you'll get a backup of 12-15hrs after 100% charge.But as I'm not a heavy user I'm getting a backup of more than 24 hrs.*Camera is also good, night mode is working good if you have a good light, if not you'll not get satisfaction.*The main issue of this phone is brightness. If you're keeping your brightness level at the lowest then you won't be able to see things properly in the night also.And outdoor you have to keep the brightness high.Which will affect your battery backup.*TIll now I have faced only one issue, which is brightness. But rest all are working fine."
"After the six months of use i would like to say it is a very good phone in this price range but within 6 month of use i am facing few problems like sometime many apps like Paytm, phonepe etc gets crashed as it is opened the contacts are not able to save as well as you cannot make calls sometimes as this app also gets crashing i have noticed this to OnePlus care also but they are clueless hope they'll soon give a update and able to fix this major problem as i don't want to do hard reset."
"First things first, this is the phone who very easily beats any redmi phone camera in this price range. So we should ignore reviews of redmi agents.Rest arePros :Clean UI,fast processing,fast charging 65 watts,display is very good,sound quality is goodCons:Back panel is plastic"
If u are not a game addict then this phone is for uhh game like bgmi nd all......battery lyf is superb.... something it slow down during online payment other than that ig does not hang
Bought this phone for my Dad who wanted to chuck away his redmi note 7. He is not a gamer and wanted a phone that doesn't hung or pop some odd instructions during UPI or credit card payments or any transactions whatsoever.  Oxygen OS is light and very user friendly. No confusions at all unlike mini for the elderly.
"Very good phone in this price range. Battery backup, camera quality, finger print reader and all features are nice. I enjoy with this phone. Thanks amazon"
Overall satisfied with the product quality and performance. Good product under this price range. The battery charging is fast and the battery backup easily lasts for a whole day with normal use ( didn't try playing heavy games)
"Best with the price range, Camera quality is not as expected. Battery life is shorten for heavy user. Games functions well and smooth. I'm satisfied with my budget."
"I am writing this review after using 5 Days this phone & 1.5 Month use of Motorola Moto G62.Performance, Camera, Battery Life, functionality of this phone is more & far Better than Moto G62.Pros.  Performance, Battery, Camera, Fast Charging (0-100% Charging in 1 hours & 10 Minutes (this is real data after charging 3 times after purchasing)).Cons.  No Measure Cons.  1- Just Price is Little higher.  2-Just some Software functions like Small Menu Apps Grid (Matrix) Bar, Font Style & Small Font Size looking like Large(That should have to be smaller than given.  There should have to option for the reduction of Small Apps Grid (Matrix) Size."

"A good quality product to buy under 20k. Ample space, good quality pictures and wider screen"
Balanced Phone for people looking out for an Daily use and Futuristic 5G Phone.
"Alexa not working properly after 2 days, otherwise mobile working is nice"
"My display sleep mode changes frequently, it goes to 15 sec automatically even I have made it to 1 min.I dnt see message count for application. It just show dots when any notification is received. I have opted for both number and dot. Then too I  can see only dot.Also finger sensor doesnot work smoothly."

"Edited after one week.Drawbacks : 1. In-display fingerint is slow as compared to my previous vivo z1x phone.2. Apps crashing some times.3. Sometimes feeling touch issues.4*. Ghost touch experienced on top status bar.5. apps don't remain in background after sometimes , if you open they start again before beginning with fresh start. It is not acceptable with ""mutitasking smartphones"".Good At: 1. Flawless with screen 90hz refresh rate.2. Camera quality is good.3. Light and sleak phone. Feels premium in handNot a recommended buy."

¬†Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good"
"Those who use internet, frequently don't go for this product. Battery backup  only comes for 10 to 12 hrs."
Must buy premium phone of OnePlus if you can afford not the cheaper one. It is good to use brand power in lower price.

Every thing is good

Best phone in budget camera could be better ! Overall good
I have use it for 2 week and did not find any issue so far..Worth to buy it.
"Still, It's maintain itself brand name i.e. OnePlus.After 7 Days used, I am writing features about this OnePlus nord ce 2 5g.1.Value for money.2.Best camera front and rear both.3.I also like it's amoled display.4.It's also contains AOD features.5.Best display.6.It's feeling similarly iPhone.7. Lightweight i.e. onehandy.But battery is 4500 mah if battery is 5000mah so it's good. But I am happy with this charger that is 65 watt. it's full battery under 30 to 40 minutes."
It's really good phone in this price segment. The camera quality and the performance is so awesome.The phone interface looks like very comfort. Battery  backup is good.Conclusion: If anyone required a smart budget phone with brand value than you can go for it.
Very nice product thankyou Amazon but delivery verry slowly

Ultra light weight, very easy to carry and watch movies during travels4. Camera is okay! Could have better.

"Using the phone for almost 15 days now and writing review,1. All functions work seamless and good.2. Phone has good build quality and has limited features of original OnePlus.3. Battery is as good as promised. It has 33W charging and phone charges in less than hour when at less than 5%4. Delivery experience was good and I chosed the phone from the authorized vendor.For mid range phone it is 4.5 / 5 and for high end perspective it is 4/5. Good phone overall."

Overall design is good.6. 65 Watt charger charging first. it takes 50 to 55 minutes for full charge.Dislikes -1. Battery performance should little better.2. During charge battery gets little heat.3. Flash light power is quite low.4. I think this phone is not water resistant also.5. There is single speaker only. Sound is quite loud but it should give two speakers atleast."
Best Mobile with high definition camera quality and fast charging...
"Be careful before you buy. The camera quality is very bad. There is a whitish tone in every photo and video, even gcam doesn't help. The type c port does not support dongle dac. The software experience is smooth but oneplus has curtailed on subtle features that are found on flagships. The feel in hand is good and feels sturdy."
I have always been a little hesitant while buying electronic items online but I had to make the purchase because I old phone died on me suddenly and I must say that this product exceeds my expectations I am really happy with the working of the product
No issues except battery life... Need Power Bank for Complete your day...

But loud.Overall it's not a topnotch phone but it's a good if are not a very very heavy user or a serious game enthusiastic.I am finding the phone quite decent
finger prints good
Every thing is good in it.Only con is no amoled display.
Not good Hanging problem
The battery is good for a moderate user but the camera quality is not up to the mark. Samsung offers much better camera and security.
Good for for day to day tasks

¬†First time finger print reader not work but after that istam work well done"
"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.Severely disappointed."
Phone performance under this budget is surprising Amazing. But the finger print reader don't work properly i have added 2 fingerprints of my own but still it don't work for half of the time . If I talk about camera so if you want to capture anything outdoor then just go for it without any doubt but it don't give satisfaction in indoor clicking. Other photos performance is much better in indoor case but for outdoor it'just wowwww .It's charges really fast and stays for long .
All superb except camera lagging issue during photography.
Mobile is weighted
Very nice
Good mobile at this price
Poco F1 series is better
A nice product go for it.
"Camera quality though being okay for this price range, everything is fine.  Best mobile to have in affordable range."

Build quilty good
"At a same time, you can not put both the sim and sd card on sametray. In tray there is 2opt only either you can  put both the sim Or one and sd card.  Overall product is good"
"Bought this phone at 22K inr. So consider this price for my review.Camera is hit and miss. Sometime it takes amazing shot, sometimes it just fumbles.EIS with 1080p60 is amazing. You will capture more videos than expected.UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in thatBattery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones."
Battery backup is very good and camera quality is good.fingerprint reader is  nice.Overall phone is good
"To be very honest I was just reviewed the viewers review and after that I brought that phone and I found what I wanted. 1+ is really premium phone and I really impressed of that phone. Everything is awesome. No hanging, No heating issue while charging. Quick charge awesome camera and awesome sound quality. Go for it every one..."
Good
Battery life is good and I liked high speed charging. So far haven't faced heating or hanging problem.  Gestures are very good. Camera features are good but portrait mode could have been better and also same goes with fingerprint.
Value for money.
Good Product

Finger print reader needs to be improved
It's like a very good phone for gaming and photo purposes and unlike OnePlus 2T and others ITS VERYYY GOOD AND WORTH THE MONEY
"Phone built, performance, battery life everything is great. Phone is great except display which is non amoled. If you are ok with it then it's great chy for you"
Superb phone but heating issue
"Overall performance is not up tonthe mark. Observed heat issues when talking more than 10 mins. Mobiles restarts randomly, display quality is not upto the mark. Redmi mobiles are far better than one plus. Over all its slwn average mobile. Not at all recommend"

The dislike part is that sometimes the volume buttons doesn't work.
Nice phone
Battery life was not satisfied
Good user experience.
Fingerprint reader is good
I like the way the phone detects the fingure print . It has the best capture quality . Altogether it's the best product I have purchased from the amazon
"I never thought that I could get such a good phone in this price point, there are so many negative comments in the review section that I was scared that what if by mistake I got the product damaged etc.... but Now there is nothing like that, the device is absolutely fine and in this price segment none can beat this device and everything is better than any other brand price point‚Ä¶ well have a nice day üòâüòâüòâ"
It's camera is the worst partCan only take decent image it's like a cheap mobile not 25k it's not worth 25k . I will suggest u go either with OnePlus Nord 2t or Samsung's iqoo etc
Worst product don't buy it just looks are good and all other things are very bad camera quality is like samsung j7 so don't buy it not at all value for money please don't buy it at all
I have been using this mobile from last 5 months i would say this is best budget phone in 25K. The best and important features of this 65W changer you don't need to worry about charging your mobile it's like blink and you will find your mobile charged in 30 minutes of time.
"Average phone . Too many bugs in the phone.But you can charge it 0%-100% around 35 minutes max.Password, or Pin, or face lock feature available for turn off the mobile."

Dont expect too many feature. Just go for the quality. Quality of the product and experience is worth the prize.
"Not the best in the segment but good enough considering one plus phone.Pros: Awesome display, Smooth performance, Really fast charging( 15 to 100 in 25 min), Decent battery backup, Blue colour looks premium and beautiful.Cons: Camera Good but not the best in the segment, Sound quality average, Not really a gaming phone, No alert slider."

¬†To give you a gist of the review, overall, the phone is 9.5/10.I'll talk about the specifics in this detailed review which shall give you the complete detailed aspect of the phone.1. DisplayThe display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.2. Processor & RamI have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.3. BatteryYour phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.4. CameraI don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.The front camera is quite good.5. Design & BodyThere is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.6. Operating SystemLoved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it."
Writing this review after using the mbl for 3 months.ProsPhone lookwise goodGood battery lifeLight weight and slimFast chargingCons1.The biggest con is its processor. Not happy with Mediatek processor and it's true that snapdragon is better than Mediatek.Processor is slow and you will feel it after using the mbl.2. Camera is just averageConclusion: One plus is loosing its glory and I don't recommend this one to buy in this range.

¬†I am editing the review what I am facing in day to day task , using the phone since 3 months :Pros:1. Performance is superb, didn't feel any lag or bug yet.( ***Edition: YouTube unexpectedly closing 2-3 times repeatedly in 1 day , that may be bug which I faced recently)2. OS & Software: Got 2 security updates & 1 Android update ( Android 11 to 12 next day after purchasing the phone)3. Battery Charging : 40-45 min approx.4. Battery Drain: 1 day for moderate user ( WhatsApp, Insta, YouTube, Online Classes etc.)5. Gaming Performance: don't play any games so look some other's review.6. Camera: Superb in day light, descent in low light.7. Speaker: Single speaker is loud enough for your entertainment.8. Refresh Rate : for day to day task, 90 Hz r.r is smooth enough to perform.9. Special Features: Pocket Mode (No accidental impression on screen when phone is in your pocket), Expernal Storage ( Most of brand neglect this), 3.5 mm jack.Cons:1. Accidental screenshot is captured due to Volume button. It should be placed on slightly upper portion. You may the face the problem whenever you lock the screen.(***Edition: You can turn off that features for screenshot in setting)2. Camera should be improved in low light.3. It must be upgraded upto Android 14.4. You can't record any call otherwise it will inform the person that you are recording the voice.Pro Tips: 1. Use ""Ultra Steady Mode"" to take video for your content/personal memory.2. Select 'Standard Refresh Rate' for better battery output.I will edit my review later if I face an issue regarding daily usage."

Battery is 4500 mah and should be atleast 6000 for this phone as per the features.

I would say its good phone in under 20000 range. Deal becomes more attractive when you get good exchange of your old phone and club it with card/special cashback/discout.
"Will get a better phone at this prize range. Camera quality is very poor 2/5. Battery is average 3.8/5. Performance 3/5. Only ine thing is Good, inhand feel. New buyers not goes to this product. Only brand name is good."

Beta mobile
I got this mobile for ‚Çπ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ‚Çπ3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ‚Çπ20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.

"Biggest mistake was to order at Amazon. I myself went at Amazon depot to receive it because delivery boy was not ready to come at 6 pm. Return is most complicated in Amazon. They fixed appointment with technician yesterday and there is no call till now. Flipkart is best to handle quality issues...Amazon broke my trust this time...it's okay for shopping upto 500/-.Camera quality is average. Battery is 4500 only but good thing is charging is very fast. Back cover provided by oneplus is white coloured which masks the appearance of mobile.Moreover, i will use it not more than 6 months due to Camera quality.....which is a little disappointing if you have used Oppo.."
"This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned. If you're someone like me, who wants to jump from the 10k range to a mid-range costing smartphone, I would suggest you go for it. My father and I bought the same phone model on the same day almost three months ago, both of us are not gamers or heavy users, but we prefer the smoothness of everyday workflow over everything else. So if you hate it when your phone takes an extended period of time to open up simple applications, you will love to upgrade to this. I had my apprehensions before buying because of the sceptical comments related to OnePlus dropping its quality, but frankly: I did not see a difference since I have never used a phone beyond the 20-25k price range. Spending more than this amount on a smartphone is just plain splurging in my opinion, especially for middle-class people like us.It does not have any apparent issues, if you take good care of it, I think it should probably last long.All in all, if you're looking for a no non-sense smartphone and think of a phone pragmatically and don't wish to delve into minute details, I would suggest going for this without any second thoughts."

Better than I expected. I don't know why people are giving negative reviews. But i love it. It's worth the price. It can be great if they added wide angle lens and 6000 mah battery instead of 5000. Overall smooth experience. I captured few landscape pictures while train is moving with the speed of 40kph

Good phone working excellent
Oneplus at this price range so you have to compromise in comparison with high-end processor and camera quality
The features of the phone are very good but this is single sim phone only.

"Lagging issue and poor camera quality, it seems like one plus tagged its name to the low quality mobile for the sake of profit. Pathetic and very disappointed"
"Very very first, smooth, camera is good, I am very happy to use it."
"Mobile is Good but camera is just ok.Storage, battery, touch and display is fantastic. Charging fast."
Superb phone worth buying
this product is good for daily usage. I have purchased it for my father. battery backup is good. camera quality is ok for this price point. overall performance is good. i recommend it for a buy.
Go for it
"Super friendly mobile, easy to use, and never hangs up. The speed is fantastic, and the battery life is long; it also charges quickly. Without a doubt, they are second only to Apple in the market. I am now a One Plus fan."
OnePlus is pathetic about updates and after each update the phone gives some issues like internet issues battery drain and now after Android 12 the phone has become like oppo phone and the feel of oxygen OS is completely gone and the brand value of OnePlus will fade if they will continue like this and this is my review after 7 months of usageScreen 5/5Battery 2.5/5Build 3.5/5Overall the phone is average considering the price and features

Product camera  wise similar oppo vivio mi poco
But the Camera quality is not good.If they increase cam quality then this phone is best
The battery is off 5000mah and it must last for atleast 1day but the phone hardly lasts for 8hrs only
"I saw many negative reviews but still went for it.. Few points i would like to clarify:‚Ä¢For people who are upgrading from redmi or other middle budget phones i will say my experience is quite good in that respect‚Ä¢battery life- i fully charged, played an hour of apex legends n genshin impact it went down to 93% with a mild warm back and on a minimal use the charge lasted about a day. But with moderate or more use it lasts about 10-12 hrs which is good enough.‚Ä¢camera - not quite great that is you wont expect this from oneplus but in this range I'll give it a solid 3/5.‚Ä¢ audio, video, wireless connectivity all seemed very smooth.‚Ä¢Design-wise it's not exactly premium looking but not totally badRest will again review after a month."

Feeling and look is good. Call recording other will be informed if you will be recording. Compass not available. VR feature also not available.

I got this phone at 10.7k during prime days (Including Exchange of 7k + Bank Offer of 2k).After a week of usage these are my reviews about the product :Camera is average and does not justify the price at which this phone is offered.Fingerprint sensor works good but sometimes I've encountered delays.Battery life is great and phone does charge quickly.Performance is great and I did not encounter any lags till date.Screen is not Amoled but won't disappoint you.

"Quite good, but budjet phone at budget quality.Screen is little greenish which is not very comfortable to view. Finger print scanner is not very responsive. Camera quality is average. Battery lasts for almost 1.5 day which is good if not the best. Front camera leaves a lot more expected.Learnt one thing. If you go for the best brand, go for their flagship products, not the budget ones."
Phone and it's functioning is good chances of lagging are negligible..Camera quality -averageBattery -averageFast charging -it take 1 hr 15 minutes to full chargeDisplay -goodFinger print senser - good if you want to buy an OnePlus phone in this range then go for it andIf your exchanging your old phone with this one then you might suffer because delivery agents create problem in exchanging phone .
"I cannot praise this phone enough for such performance at this price range. I was considering yo buy iPhone SE but then I saw a OnePlus phone at 18,999 which was a bit odd to me. So I researched about the phone and turns out this is the best budget friendly phone you can buy!! Absolutely stunning camera, Oxygen OS optimises the apps to perfectly that background apps don't drain your battery. It charges fast and you can just charge it 30mins in the morning before you leave for college or work and it'd be at 100% . I'll be uploading a few pictures taken from this device just to show the camera's brilliance. At this price, I'd suggest that it's totally worth it to buy this OnePlus device and not go for other brands."
"Good Build quality,"
Missing AMOLED Screen
"This phone is really amazing, smooth working. No lagging at all. Fulfilling all my needs like frequent UPI payments, bankings, trading, watching some videos, reading the content, long official meeting, clicking some important pictures etc.If you are a normal user, it is best deal. For gamers and selfie queens, I am not sure whether this phone will be a good or not."

"This is for the people who want to go with a stable brand.If you want to buy iPhone 11 but due to budget constraints you are not able to buy then this is the phone which is handy to use does all the necessary work, and captures great images. The looks are awesome but the plastic back panel disappointing it could be glass. The good thing is you get one plus stickers and a plastic back cover with damage protection (the design of the back cover in a way that it protects your mobile glass from the damage the corners are edgy) so you don't need to buy it with extra cost. Just go for it I bought it for 23999. Very smooth and slick handset. It's not grey...complete mirror but with a black tone. silver you can consider. light weight."

"I was deeply saddened by the unprofessional attitude of the seller. The seller (DARSHITA ELECTRONICS) lacked a basic sense of packaging delicate & costly items like smart phones. I received my phone poorly packed & moreover, the phone was shipped along with grocery items like liquid detergent & mosquito repellent in the same box, with no proper instructions & labelling. Thanks to God that my phone was working. Amazon needs to be much cautious in coordinating & instructing the seller."

But i don't use camera at all, i saw the reviews about bad camera before purchasing but anyways decided to buy it because i wanted a phone with headset jack.. anyways I'm happy with the phone but will not recommend anyone as there are other phones within the same price range that has better specs.."

After updating software many features are useless.5.Good things.1 photos in outdoor and in good light are very good specially in portrait mode.2. Battery charging is amazing ..you never feel when its charging 15 minutes are enough for the day.3. Good touch .4. Sound quality is awesome5 camera is ok6. Fingerprint sensor is awesomeOverall is all good but not happy on performance because i use trading apps and its get crushed app while switching to another app
I found out that the battery life is better than i expected several people where complaining over display brightness but I don't find any problems regarding itCamera is decent i hope they fix camera issues by updates in futureO.S is actually pretty goodFinger print and face unlock takes a bit second to unlock...

"I am a long time One plus user and very fond of the quality of these phones and it's softwares. But after using this phone I am disappointed. It lags whenever watching movie on Prime or Zee5, video lags. Even while getting call its screen gets white and after 10 seconds you will get to know that flaa person is calling.Earlier I was using One plus 7T now I am literally missing that phone."
Automatically the dark mode comes on. The radio icon or the compass icon is not inbuilt.
Great phone for an under 20k budget. Battery life is very good and so isfast charging. Touch response and fingerprint reader are on point as well. Camera is not the best out there but it does a decent job.
Camera quality is poor

Overall good phone..but battery backup may be issue for heavy user..
It is the best phone for performance and battery... But display has a thicker chin which may be disappointing.... But the 90hz display is the best one for this price definitely recommend at this price with good capable rear cam

"we could not judge a phone on 5 to 6 days used, as initially  i feel that the 1 plus nord CE2 having good features & its really feel smooth during handling , & having feel brand value too..but i expected that after 1 yr or onward the phone should have same consistency too... at that time we can say that brand value are trustworthy...because we have also pay same for that comparing to other branded phone.. but now overall is amazing lets see onward..."
Not so good like. It can be better
Everything is good... Camera is top notch... Just one con.. Battery gets drained within 1 day even if u don't use it...but it charges to 100% within 15 mins bcoz of ultra fast charging so no issues as such.. Go and buy this beastüî•üî•üî• in Affordable pricing Range ..

¬†Im writing this review after using the mobile for one month . The purpose of writing the review is to help the ppl who are planning to buy this phone. Even i do read read the reviews before purchasing any product online. if the review is honest it helps customers to take decision. If we talk about phone...the phone is very average. its design is very catchy but performance is very average. Battery of of phone drains very fast. Theres some heating issues issues in the phone . The phone hangs most of the times. The fingerprint sensor lags. There are lots of bugs in the phone. one of the biggest issue is after disconnecting the call..the call connect logo remains on ghe home screen."
I liked processor and ram .Display is ok .Camera is not nice.
Fabulous phone.. Built quality awesome... Camera is just wow... Battery backup is longer n longer.. Go for it.. Must buy
Battery lyf is good...Not much heating issues...Charger is awesome...However screen goes completely white for a moment while I make calls ....
Battery backup has been Best

May rank low in terms of popularity/ usgae but is a worthy buy.
Value for money.
Writing this Review after one month of Usage: The Performance was Extremely Good at this Price Range. Brand Value Speaks. Camera quality equals to Iphone. Battery life was little bit Disappointing but we have Ultra Fast 65W Charging it may take just 15 mins to get full charge! Remaining everything was Perfect!
Battery life goodCharging speed goodCamera not as much as expectedPerformance overall good not excellent in thi priceNot for gamers
The product was delivered on the same day of the order & it was a surprise for me.Till now it's satisfactory in use. I m happy üòä with the product.

Processor & Dual Mode video etc. Forget about Amoled Display because You are getting OnePlus in this range it's a big Deal. This brand has a extra charge that's why others Company always tries to give extra features. It's all about Brand Value. I love this phone. Go for it."

Everything is ok but plastic body that is bad which is cons. of this mobile otherwise I would give thumps up.

"Review after 10 days.It's a very good and practical phone if you are able to purchase it under 20k by applying coupons and exchange.Build : I like metal build but Ok with the plastic and Glass builds as well. This is very light and compact phone made by plastic back and frame.Display : 90 Hz is a sweet spot. Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box."

3rd class camera quality in indore
"+ves1. Good camera2. Excellent response to touch3. Installation of all apps from previous phone (without direct transfer) and readiness to use was very good4. Input for earphones (with wire) is designed to take any earphone, they got away with previous model, a big relief5. Lighter in weight, sleek and thinner, Grey Mirror looks very stylish-ves1. Longer time to recharge battery, OnePlus was a class act, even after using for 3 years, battery recharge was done in 1 hour!2. Changes in user interface, made adaption little tricky3. Speaker sound part could have been better"
Just the brand name... Just the Oxygen OS is good... The user interface is good... The camera is not well

"Great Camera Sensors, great battery , nice looks, perfect performance, good product üíØ"
Thanku very much
This is a good phone. Easy of handling and battery life is good.
I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Battery üîã stays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camera üì∏ is not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.

Phone is average. Camera quality is average too(4*). I am using this phone since last two months. But in the software OnePlus need to improve. Like you could not able to know incoming during the calls (2*) and notification light is not available(0*). Notification sound is very low(2*). Charging is good (5*). Display (5*). Phone is clean by software (not must settings like oppo and Vivo).

Pros:-10/10 Very Light Weight So easy to grip.9/10 Phones design and UI design is good.10/10 Very Fast Charging takes 30 to 40 minutes to full charge.8/10 Camera quality is decent.9/10 Good for first time buyer.Cons:6/10Sometime found leg while swipe up  swipe down UI but ok.7/10 Found that you can't make dual app of some apps.
"Battery life is good, easily lasts a day for my usage, with frequent chat updates, some music playing, once or twice camera usage etc.Display quality, photo quality, sound quality are all above average.However, a bug that disappointed me is that the fingerprint sensor doesn't turn on even in always on display mode. And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now."

This phone has hanging problemNo ir blaster for controlling TV or ACAlso network problem occurs in the phone a lot of time.

Am disappointed with battery because comparing to normal realme redmi OnePlus is poor in battery lifeBut one advantage is 65w fast charge
OnePlus should not sell such cheap mobiles.Quality should be maintained.

"I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period."

"Camera is good but not very advance.finger print, battery life is quite good.charger is not that fast as it claims.i have realme note 9 pro 5g is good."
cool phone
Its a nice deal in this range which comes with brand value of Oneplus. It is suitable for normal use and one full charge stands complete day. I have bought this phone for my mom and she is enjoying it.
But I like it
"Its a performance packed, smooth and amazingly fast mobile for the price one pays. Camera pack an extra punch. Only issue I find is a bit bulky and battery life a bit faster draining...however the overall feeling is of happy customer...üòÄüòÄ"

You will get 7-8 hrs of screen on time in a single charge.Finger print scanner works pretty fast, but after I put after market screen protector it's not functioning properly.So just go for the original OnePlus screen protector."
All are good
Camera quality is good.
For personal use
"Great Camera, Image processing even when zoomed max. Big lences make ligh go in with great pictures. Super Battery life and Super fast Charging. Looks even great with reflective back. Great Screen with good screen brightness good in sharp sun.Great phone to buy at 25k."

"Have been using this phone since the last one and half months and it's been going really fine although to say that I don't play any mobile games of any sort which is a kind of relief for any kind of phone.Although it's a rebranded version of Realme 9Pro Plus with mostly the same hardware and design but it's superior than the latter in most of the segment be it camera processing, display or processing power cause it has a refined software which is the OxygenOs and comes with a lot less bloatware than the latter.The only downgrade I felt in this phone is it's speaker which is a mono one and not the regular stereo one but it can get pretty loud but lacks smoothness and let me tell you the absence of a AMOLED screen is not a con cause although it lacks it but the blacks are blacker and it's relatively brighter even with a LCD panel and it gets pretty bright when outside or under the Sun otherwise all other components of the device works pretty well considering it's below 20k price tag.So, this was what I felt after using the device for one and half months."
Best phone in all segments but  1 issue finger senser week
Great battery life even at full use I can easily use it for 24 hrs and only take 1hr:20min to charge fully.Camera it not the best but we can take great photo using pro mode.Easy to use and refresh rate is also good. The mobile don't get hang it's quite smooth.And I suggest it is one of best mobile under 20k
"Battery is good,camera is also good and everything is good"

"Latest technology, Light weighted, speedy functioning, User friendliness, quickly chargeable and amazing sound are some of the plus points which i'm getting in this mobile."

Amazing product in this range. It‚Äôs wow product.
This is not optimum account it's brand name. Camara quality is average. Bettery life is not much good. Finger scanner is not comfortable with cover. Overall is average experience with this phone but not happy with this Brand name. OnePlus is OnePlus but its just like Mi. I'll suggest please find better option before buying this product.
"Battery life is very good,Camea quality is good for day however for night mode not so good,Charging is fast,Fingerprint sensor sometimes not responsive, they should have provided in backOverall best in budget!"

"Recommended for casual use. Quick battery charge, battery life's for a day considering high usage of 8-9hrs. As it is oxygen OS no bloatware issues. Screen touch works good, no delay seen.Disappointment is,- Android 11 ver.- Slight scratches on backcase. Ignorable, though matters.- Uniqueness mark of the brand is missing.Cons,- Camera quality not upto the mark.- Low sound.- Battery heats up very quickly while using high utilisation apps.- Can't use hotspot for morethan 2hrs, again battery issue.- Not recommended for gamers."

It's hang lagging and heating as normal weather ‚òÅÔ∏è condition.I purchased very expensive phone but very worst phone in my whol life ..
Sound quality is poor
Camera not good and touch speed also and one more thing this is u delevary orginal mobile tell me y because this not look like
"Actually the rating is three and half stars. Since there's no provision for half star so I've rated it Three! Especially recommended to those who haven't experienced the OnePlus' Oxygen OS so far. For the uninitiated, Oxygen OS provides the bloatware-free OS. Closer to near stock Android.  No spammy notifications like Xiaomi or even Samsung nowadays. Mostly bug-free. The interface is neat.Battery is awesome. Easily lasts whole day with moderate to heavy usage.Camera is just above average.Display is great though it's LCD. Since it's LCD so obviously there's no in-screen fingerprint scanner. It's embedded with physical power button. So people looking for in-screen fingerprint scanner might feel disappointed.Sometimes screen remains dark and unresponsive despite ringing which can be resolved with new S/W patch provided OP deems it worthy to address. Obviously it can't be compared with it's more expensive cousins but overall a nice big phone and the best in this price range. Definitely worth a try, especially if you haven't used Oxygen. For the rest, be adventurous, try something new if you can, otherwise it's always a safe bet."
Nice one at this price

Received on time. Excellent phone
Camera quality is Average. As compared to other OnePlus flagship phones . Display is nice but not balanced as compared to amoled Sumsung. Speakers works well but unbalanced sound because of single speaker and cracky sound on high volume. Touch is smooth and satisfied with the refreshrate.

"Display is quite big screen -FHD+ with 120 hz refresh rate, the viewing angles are good and optimised, but still there should be like AMOLED is not there which is now common in other same segment phones, It is 5G with 7 bands so will not be any problem related to network. The camera gives some good shots, Oxygen OS is good with no bloatware that is impressive when you compare with others. Overall decent under the 20k segment and with good brand value."
Just amazing
"After 2 month of use,I found this is very good mobile with smooth operation.Pros..- Excellent battery backup, beyond a day- Super Voot is highly fast than our thought- Superb processor- Good main camara- Very good AMOLED display- Near to pure android- No lag while heavy gamingCons...- Missing RAM expansion- In screen fingerprint sensor some time don't recognise- Battery charged with super voot is draining some what faster then 10w charge- It is rebranded Oppo Reno 7All over is good mobile with great battery optimisation and beast for the GamersGo blindly if you want to buy mid price phone with great performance"
Great performance
Very nice
"One plus phones have always amazed me by the time duration they live as compared to Samsung's, Redmi's and Vivo's. Its a decent mid level phone with great battery life for people who have long screen times for videos and camera functions. Android and One plus UI 12 is a great skin on the vanilla OS.Pros:Great battery life.Good screen sizeForm factor is good. Camera is decent for the cost. Love the dual video feature, not sure when I will use it.No unnecessary stock apps like samsung and vivo.Trust Snapdragon as compared to mediatek in CE versionFuture proof as its 5g.Cons:A bit bulky to carry in hand for long times (watching video)More color options would have been good."

"Fantastic phone , enhanced battery life, easy to recharge , fine picture, one plus features,  only one drawback when we want to record voice ,other person  aware that his voice is being recorded, it may be due to phone policy.Otherwise phone is one of best"
"Camera is worst in that price ,earlier I have redmi node 9 PRO MAX cost 17k his camera better than this.Batery time is also lessMost important thing no option to go back at any page and in apps many time start things from begining due to no back button as compare to other phonesVery difficult to use this phone ,background app doesn't comes easily again on screen for that makes hard effort.Showing msg format is very ugly.Overall very disappointed to purchase this phone."

"It has good battery backup, display, camera etc. Touch and fingerprint responsiveness is great. Game playing feel good. No hearing issue. Battery lasts for a day with moderate to high usage. Could have been better if it's amoled and stereo speaker support. Feels like a realme phone with oxygen OS inside. Some phones in similar category has led and stereo. So those looks for budget friendly 1+ branded phone, go for it. Others think twice. I like my purchase and hope you all too.."
As we all know its reputed premium brand and that u can get at 20k whats more u can ask
I received the defect product the battery was drain quickly compare to normal
"Till now i am using feom last 3 months and it gives me a wonderful experience apart from one sound issue from phone calldespite that issuei have done factory reset to resolve that issue. However overall a wonderful experience with phone.

That's very good
Nice mobile
Camera  Quality is very low...
Some feature are not user friendly
Camera quality is very poor
It's been a month and phone is just ok... nothing great or good about it. I m bit worried that performance definitely worsen with passage of time. Many a times phone goes blank...no app to access. While playing games it's not at all good experience. My last phone was redmi note 8 pro and it was faaaaaar aheadof this phone in almost every aspect. The only good thing about this phone is that u can fully charge it in 35-40 minutes.
"So it's been about a week that I am using this phone and I don't regret buying it. Its 90 Hz refresh rate is so smooth. Got two security patch updates too in a week which is really a great thing.The camera is really good. The phone looks premium and is lightweight and slim. It feels good in hand.Even though the speaker is mono firing speaker and not stereo speakers, it really is very loud. The screen is beautiful and there's Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the front and back.Now, coming to the battery, it easily lasts a whole day and it charges real quick and you're ready to use it whole day (100% battery)after just 35-40 mins of charge.I do casual gaming (BGMI and COD) and I didn't find any lag or jitter. So no complain about that.So overall satisfied with this phone so far."

"I bought this phone during the Monsoon carnival. My budget was around 20k and I wanted to try OnePlus for the first time. After 20 days of usage, I feel the phone is genuinely good to use. The Screen Refresh rate is 120hz, pretty smooth and quick. Camera is decent as well, not the best of course but does the job tbh. Rest all features are good and one won't be dissatisfied. I'm super angry with Amazon's exchange service. I had requested an exchange for my old samsung device. I had an 4400 off the purchase price. But the delivery agent rejected the phone exchange. Phone is still working fine, it just had some scratch on the back due to wear and tear which is normal. But it was rejected and I had to pay the difference. Worst exchange service ever. Will never again order a phone from Amazon."

"Here are some important points that I noticed about the smartphone :1. Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 years warranty. Seems like company is pretty sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.I am thankful to the seller for providing me the phone in best condition and I thank Amazon for free and fast delivery."
"Phone is good, software & camera quality is also good but a minor problem is that the side panels of mobile phone are not scratche proof after using only 20 days i have small small tiny spots on side panel & the back side quality is also poor if you have your bike key & Mobile phone in same pocket then it can make scratches on back side , not happy at allüòë"

Using this mobile more than a month. Felling premium phone . Overall best in this range.
I am writing this review after using the phone for a week. The phone and it's performance is awesome camera is also gud there are many hidden features which needs to be searched in YouTube or Google. The charging speed is very good. I have rated 4 stars only bcoz of battery life is not upto mark of we use the phone regularly battery wil last long for one day. Over all in this budget it's an good phone to buy.
Think twice before purchasing this mobile. Don't tempt with fast charging. It is fast draining also. How about changing your mobile 100% twice a day.
Everything is great

No words just go and buy itüòä
"Worst battery backup, Not suitable for those who travel."
"normal phone, 8gig ram, 128gig storage okay good then? come to the performance, its better, yes.what about cam & pic quality? please don't ask. battery & charging? quick charging with 65W but drains quickly too. think and compare with other bands before you plan to buy this for 24999/- (no interested with samsung, or mi products so no nokia, motorola, sony obviously choice left with oppo, vivo or 1+)review update : (13-08-22) After recent Android update this phone is really serving its manufactured purpose."
It's a good product
Like this product....
I am satisfied with the phone and camera
Pros: 1. Very fast charging. 65 wats2. Display quality is very good.3. In display fingerprint sensor.4. Dimensity 900 very smart processor5. Gorila glass 5 tough displayCons:  1.back is plastic very thin2. Scrach may appear even using case3. Camera is not top level as compared price4. Ram management is little poor
"One month experience,koi problem nhi hai."
The Best Phone to Purchase in Handy Price... There is only one issue if you watch videos on OTT platform if you keep in the video on full-screen it get stuck and video starts to play slow rest every processor of phone is amazing...
Good quality
Best phone in budget
Sensor is good
Very light weight and value for money.Camera quality is too good in this price.
Overall performance is good but gets heat up very quickly. I recommend this to one whose budget is less and also want to have one plus.. It will surely not disappoint you‚úå
Good as expected

"I have no point of comparison except for my older oppo A83(2018) model. Thats an older model and yet very much better than the new ONE PLUS.  I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.üòû DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full. Thats the only feature I love about it."
after using one month i wirite this review1. Hang problem2. Screen Freez problem
It's generating a lot of heat with a 5 min talk
Sometimes Phone is getting hanged. Showing call symbol even after call disconnect.

Battery life not good
Pros- Camera is fine- Overall performance is fine- Good screen size- UI is responsive- Charing is really very fast- Its 5G by the wayCons- No return policy- Gmail notification will not work in this phone.- Does not seems fit in this price range. We can get good phone in this price
Battery üîã life in average but takes very less time to recharge so it is okay. Camera is better than other phones of this range. Display is smooth and processor is as expected by one plus. I have previously used one plus 3T for 4 years. Definitely the quality of one plus phones is still up to mark. The only thing I didn't like is mirror back of phone as now a days better looking phones are available.

"Good budget 1+, bad battery life for some reason, amoled also not the best, but overall great for price"
"I have exactly used it for 2 months , All the features are great and camera quality is absolutely mind-blowing.U r phone get charged immediately within 30 to 40 mins to 100%> And there is optimised charging mode which it detects automatically when you charge it at late nights so that over hours battery condition doens't get bad"
Phone bar bar hange ho raha hai

I like this phone very awesome quality fingerprint sensor too fast battery long lasting and camera not like 1+ mobile but good in this price
One plus claim to have hdr 10+ certified dis play but it doesn't support hdr videos playing.otherwise all are good.
Display is not showing sharp resolution. Viewing images or videos doesn't show any difference. But normal usage the texts are not crisp.
Nice camera and battery life. Overall a good product.
First time OnePlus buyer... I knew the phones were good however never experienced it... Was using Redmi Note 7s for last 4 yrs.. Thought of switching to another brand..... OnePlus as always met expectations....
Superb phone under this segment
Good phone.
It's compitibale with high range...... And in this budget no one brand give this feature.... Must buy...... wonderfull.....
Performance is very important and it's here
Best Phone in this rate
"Pros:1. One plus mobile in range of 25k2. Resolved some bugs that was in Nord 2.3. Sound is good and much loud.4. Charging is fast, just need 25-30 mins for 0-100%5. Display is much bright and full HD.6. Dedicated Sim Slot to extend ROM7. Performance is smooth even heavy games and applications is installed.Cons:1. Camera is not that good as expected from ONE+ , photos in dark are good but not satisfied. If we zoom images, pixels get scattered and image quality falls.2. Screen Lock fingerprint sometimes does not recognize quickly and shows wrong finger error.3. Android OS is still 11, It should be current OS."
Very good mobile @ use time is smoothi opretion

"Reduced one start because of camera quality and not having AMOLED display. Rest Phone works very smooth and 5G will make phones life longer. But yeah, I don't think there is any better phone with this price tag, because you have to sacrifice something to have something in the same price."
Battery quality is very bad üòûüòûüòû and camera quality quality is good in starting but when not good
Good one
Phone hanging issue from day 1.... May be it is phone specific..but really disappointed
"We had an iPhone and I can say that OnePlus stood the test, it's great at the same time we bought this phone for wife and oppoA15s for me, although this OnePlus phone is double the price compared to my oppoA15s but still the quality of this OnePlus phone is 10 times better. I am not a customer who will give 5 stars just like that, it really exceeded expectations"
As mentioned in other reviews this phone indeed has decent camera quality compared to other phones in this budget band. But I found other features that are unique to this phone mentioned below.1.  NFC ( I know small feature but no other phone includes this one under 25K)2.  65W Charging3.  Wi-Fi 64.  Wi-Fi Tethering5.  LDAC Codec supportedand trust me Bahamas Blue color is awesome!!!
"Good to buy , it is better phone"

Nice phone.Worth every single penny
Phone is very slim and light weight having mirror look at backside.Camera quality is decent not so good for photography and 4k recording is also decent like 1080p recording.There is no heating issue with phone no lag still when I was using wifi with several apps open then it got stuck once when a call came but that's not happening frequently.Overall it's a nice phone with everything upto the mark and having decent camera and awesome speaker sound quality.

¬†I have seen worst packing ever. No protection, nothing. It‚Äôs 20k phone. Not 20 rupees soap. Anyone can replace this product with anything. Be serious, and make genuine packing."
Switch off mobile charge No Sir
Best quality is one plus
"Good phone, good experience, but a bit heavy.One drawback is that at the backside, camera is not at the same level as rest of the cover, it's a cm higher, which increases the chances of camera cover glass being scratched whever phone is kept anywhere."
Definitely not worth the price
"Very good phone at this price segment, especially when the brand name is one plus. After 1 wk of extensive use i don't find any problem as of yet. But one thing I must say, back camera quality can be a bit more better. There is no lagging, UI is super smooth"
"Battery life is really good, camera is not up to mark, no hang problem"
It was good product in budget
"It's very good Android 5g phone in this price, sufficient space of 128gb with 6gb ram. No issue as using more than 15 days."
"Oneplus making a poor quality camera phone in this range built quality is not up to mark and fingerprints sensor is not fast as it can. I think it will comes in only 10, 000 range, better to go with Samsung M series phones high price for this product."
Quality se compromise kiya gaya hai lekin thik h
Value for money
Battery backup not good
Working good
Camera quilty very poor veryyy bad like8 megapixel camera
"The 6.59-inch LCD display comes with 1080√ó2412 pixels and 401 PPI pixel density. The phone offers a 20:9 aspect ratio and a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus has tried to balance it out with support for a 120Hz refresh rate display. But that doesn‚Äôt take the focus away from the display being dull from some of the rivals in the segment. Coming back to the display performance, the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G offers smooth animations, all thanks to the higher refresh rate. Mind you that the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G packs a higher refresh rate than what we get on the OnePlus Nord CE 2, which is a bit costly.We had a good time using the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G display as it supported HD content on popular OTT apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The panel is bright and offers swift colours. Though, we have to admit that it missed the punchiness of an AMOLED panel.Overall, it strikes a balance of an inferior panel and a fast refresh rate which should work well for most users in this price segment."
Like that product go for it
One of the worst product launched by OnePlus

Poor camaraCopy device like Realme or other under 14k.Only placed brand name.If you want only brand name to show then it's good.

"I purchased this phone few days back.. I was samsung user first.. Now Talking about oneplus nord ce 2 CONS: Its Battry life is average.. gives one day backup om heavy use. Secondly no stereo speakers that is major issue i faced. Camera quality is below average, and i personally didn't liked user interface. Samsung is really easy to use devise.Pros - light weight and feels premium, Display is very good and touch is so responsive, Gorilla Glass protection and very Fast Charging"
"very good phone, just go for it"
Display is darker it's not white and camera quality is not good waste of money due to brand name buy oppo or Vivo or redmi in very low price 15000 get better than this OnePlus quality phone
Don't buy this phone if you are expecting a good battery life from this

Touch screen is not good.While on calls the number gets automatically dialled
Camera quality 7 out of 10 rest are ok
I have been using this phone for the past 3 to 4 days so I noticed a few pros and cons:Pros :1. light weight and the slimmest one2. Fast charging3. Offcourse very good display for Netflix and Amazon.4. Good performance not even a slightest lag I faced.5. Oxygen OS so no bloatware and ads.Cons:1. Camera is not that good and not that bad...average.2. Phone gets warmer while playing games and also while charging specifically between 20 to 80%.That is also I could notice.
"Mobile looks awesome and slim grip is good, camera is average, feel good in hand but back glass is still a problem in summer time as it looks very cheap when you see lots of finger prints on it with very less use.Every thing is fine but the best part is battery charging it just takes only 30-32 minutes to charge 100%Overall experience is good with this mobile."
I love this phone
"We all know about OnePlus device and how good they are, this is no exception. It's really good and budget smartphone"

"I am writing this review after 15 days of usage.The phone is excellent in class. It's faster, smarter and better. The best thing about it is the superfast 65W charging feature. It charges the phone from 15%-100% within half an hour. Camera quality is also impressive. This is the first time I am using a OnePlus phone and I am not regretting at all."

Camera is superb, battery is good,  charging is really fast and touch is way too much premium than redmi and samsung( below 20 K range). Thus for me it is a brilliant phone."

¬†I have been looking to buy this phone for a long time. The phone is worth its price. I am writing this review after a month of use.Good quality. Very fast. A single charge should last 10-12 hours (minimum) if you are not a gamer or a constant user of the phone. And it comes with a 65w charger. It only takes 20 minutes to go from 0 to 80%. It also has a good processor. It also provides a free case. Overall it is a budget friendly phone for the average user."

Phone has good looks. Performance is nice. Missing sterio speaker at this price.
I like front camera and light weight.Battery life is worst.. This phone has battery draining issue. As I pay for this product this is not that worth full. I can not use even you tube for 1 hour in this. I forgot use other OTT apps to use after buying this product. Just cause of battery draining issue. I ask for replacement 1st time but the replaced product has the same issue.
Better Life is small low

Does the job....

"Camera quality is average. Network and sound quality is not good specially during WhatsApp or internet calls. Also, red cable charger is not of same quality as being provided with other OnePlus phones.This is just an average phone, which has no special features one thinks after listening OnePlus brand name."

¬†Good Phone."
"1. Camera is outstanding. Macro,wide angle and normal. All are up to the mark.2. With 65W super vooc charger in 20 mins charge goes from 43 to 100.3. But battery life is low. I was just editing a normal video and charge went from 100 to 84 within an hour.4. Heating up issues not severe.5. Use a phone case from the very first day as there will fall quite a lot of fingerprints on the phone back6. Liked the rear camera placement and looks of the phone."
"Mobile performance super but ,bettery performance low"
I like everything except proximity sensor. Proximity sensor is not working properly.
"Battery is good , finger print reader is very good and camera needs to improve"
"The Android software seems to be working well. But the Hardware is of poor quality. When I took off the sim tray, the impressions are bad. The sim tray seems to be made from a local machine and of poor quality. Not expected from this manufacturer.  What else is there inside the mobile phone ? Not known to me. I hope company is listening. Plz refine your hardware. Google has provided Android, you do your part as good."
"OnePlus phone are good in premium range only.Its hanged when used phone core applications like Phone dialer, calender etc."

"Very powerful, fast, and feature-rich phone at a very reasonable price. It's not the best of the lot that OnePlus provides but gives you value for money.  I have been using iPhone X for the past 4 years and have recently shifted to OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite with 8GB RAM... I love the experience. The only issue which I am facing is with transferring phone numbers from an IOS device to Android, otherwise, I am good with this device.Highlight - good battery backup (much better than IOS devices) and awesome connectivity with Android Auto and good music output."

"I purchased one plus nord 2T and that has heating issue and I returned that and brought this handset , this is far better than Nord 2T in all the means, and I loved this handset"
In this segment it is top rated. You cannot get a better one at this cost.
Mostly good phone but when we using camera it not clear as the brand one plus is mostly a well knowing bran for its camera quality. I m very much disappointed for its camera quality. I asked for the refund but they did not do this till date.

This phone are good
I will not give detailed review about technical specifications...If you are normal user and looking for a mid range mobile then you can bilndly go for this.
"Performance is best , just disappointed with camera and battery. It's not that good"
"I bought this phone on the 1st day of launch without knowing what I am going to get from it. But after receiving the phone, I'm quite happy. The phone is fast, light & good in performance. The only drawback for me is that the battery charger doesn't holdup well. For someone who uses the phone only for work & internet, I have to charge twice daily. But it does charge in 15 mins! It's a good buy though!"
"According to the mobile price I think it is not value for money product. In this price range there should be more improvement. Battery backup is very bad.Camera quality is average.Not for game.Apart from these, mobile is light-weighted."
LIKE BUT FUNCTION OF RECORDING DISLIKE
Nice but charging slow.
Good camera
Poor battery. Drains very fast.Hangs often with just ordinary usage. No special/gaming apps used.Just an ordinary phone. Nothing special as of one+Similar to any 12k - 13k phone.

This is entry level smartphone from OnePlus. Don't expect magic out of the box. This phone is for those who don't expect much from an entry-level phone.The camera app in this device is very good. The AI function in camera is working fine. Colors don't look natural in HDR mode. The tripod mode is useless without a tripod. Video stabilization is very good.

I like the 120hz refresh rate as it is very smooth and it feel really nice.Camera quality should improve.

Thik thak hai
"It's just a Android phone with OnePlus branding. It came with lots of bugs. Camera also average not like anyone can expect from a OnePlus phone.Indisplay fingerprint and face lock are not fast as other brand phones.Charging is fast, but if you use a little bit while charging the speed will reduce automatically to 50watts. Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12. It's just one weeks of usage and there's a lot of issues don't know where to report.Thanks for reading. This is my honest review on this device."

I am in love with this phone. The battery life is just too good. Gets charged so quickly ..... In about 15 minutes and goes on for almost 2 days. Camera is also good. I have switched from iphone and I am very happy with the battery specifically.
Good
Fingerprint reader area is too much small
"This was my first phone above 20k, and tbh, it's not bad. I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. It gets the job done fast, and comes with a boatload of features too."
Performance Exceptional no lags..Fast charge.Camera and battery backup could have been better at this price range
This is the best Oneplus Nord smartphone which is far better than Oneplus Nord 2T in terms of battery life and camera quality.
"Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good. See attached photo taken from 5 th floor.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Netflix. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 yes warranty. Seems like company is preety sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.Best of luck Chinese company... Till the time India doesn't develop its own effective mobile, keep earning. We will catch you soon!!"

Camera quality is very poor according to the price and the display also should be amoled. The phone processor is good. The phone lags many features according to the price. Only OnePlus brand makes it premium phone but the phone is not upto the mark.
Loved the phone since day 1. Although a little disappointed design wise but performance is quick and efficient.

"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it."
Phone getting heat
"Software glitch is a big issue. Sometimes something works, sometimes it doesn't. Moreover, they are still using the Android 11. They must give the latest version since they are taking 25K.Yes, the battery and charger is quite good. It charges to full in almost 45 minutes and if you charge for 10 minutes, you can run it for 2-3 hours. But one problem - device shuts down without any prior warning when battery is down."
Nice cover
Heating problem & battery problem
Mobile is good easy to use with single hand and the best part is the 3.5mm headphone Jack slot included

I was an ONEPLUS 6 User since 4 years and though it was a downgrade for me but trust me apart from Amoled Display and camera performance there is nothing what this phone lacks for it has got an excellent batteryOne with the budget of 20k should definitely go for this if you can compromise on AMOLED Display
Superb

Display is a bit small compare to the same range other brands phones. Camera quality is good

"Camera quality is average. Feels very good while using. Battery upto mark. Display very good. Phone overall look very good. Some bugs are there such as while gaming a notification regarding cpu, GPU, and graphics constantly popping down. Dual volte icon problem."
Overall phone is decent no as such issues. Battery drain fast although it got quickly charged too.
"I really loved the product it killed in performance, battery life and camera but there were tiny bits where improvement can be made like the fingerprint scanner is slow, gliding through UI feels slow and it doesn't come with Android 12."
I used this phone from last 2 months and it's really good.
Phone is decent in but camara is below average in this price segment could have been better but i got this deal in 17k because of exchange of old phone make this deal awesome but if I speak in 24k you can choose more feature loaded smartphone compared to nord CE2 ‚úåüèª

Inbuilt radio not seen along with lack of stereo sound speakers and low level camera lense quality used for night photography. Needs to improve it in future updates. Days photos are good one. Battery is good one. I like it.

"This phone is worth buying for its build quality and smooth usage and the fast battery charging, and side finger print sennsor"
The phone is good and value for money. But if you want to buy one plus in budget then prefer one plus Nord ce2 rather than this product.

After using it for 5 months I didn't face any issue.
"I recently purchased this phone. I imagined a One Plus phone with a mid-range price. It has to be a good phone. I've been using it for about a month. In comparison to my previous phone¬†Samsung M30,¬†¬†I am having a very bad experience with the camera of one plus nod ce2 and¬† The shutterspeed is extremely slow. If you need to take a photo, this phone¬†¬†needs a trypod, otherwise the photo will be blurry or shaken. And while the phone is locked, you can easily enable hotspot features. very bad experience"

Just heating issue with phone and charger while charging...rest all is well
"Swtiched from Apple after 15 years, Really happy that I dnt have to charge my phone 3 times a day. Battery life if way too good. Only problem is the the mirror at back of phone is very delicate, should have been scratch proof"

"At this price point the camera is below average, non amoled display,feels cheap. Specs are average. Feels so fragile in hand. Sound output is average too. After using likes of one plus 3, 5t and 7 t, it is not at all worthy. At the given price a other phone have better specsEdit - the most buggiest mobile of 1 plus . Somehow out of nowhere contacts are deleted on its own and you have to restore it everytime. Secondly no matter how many times notification of apps is switched off, it comes on automatically. Camera is worst ever."

"It seems good for now, let us explore all features and experience in few days."
Also Cell phone cover which is hold with box is within a week change color.It's during delivery white and now it's Yellow.One Plus CE2 5G not a good quality its to much decrease quality even finger sensor not working properly number of user commant about finger lock.To to bad experience wrost case I think I can buy Same phone and same Quality Redmi Note 10 pro which is almost half price so go with Redmi Note 10 pro instead of Redmi Note 11 pro.10 and 11 have same thing and processor but if you go with 10 you can save extra 2000/-
Everything is working fine.

"One plus Nord is not up to three name of one plus. The software is little buggy. When a message is typed, the app gets swapped with another one suddenly. User would be stuck to know what had happened.  Fingerprint reader disappers sometimes when a call is in progress. The buttons on homescreen goes away while a call is in progress. There is no lift to wakeup option. Fingerprint reader under the display is really really inconvenient. Chrome tab gets closed with no default blank tab. The annoying privacy alerts when a video call happens, even after notification is turned off."

Calls communication is completed but not phone off
Overall nice phone
camera pictures quality is good.
I have used the phone more than 4 months. Battery backup is not up to the mark. Intially the battery gets charged very quickly but now it takes time to get charged. Camera quality is average and in low light it is worst. Not expected from one plus.  Touch is also average. Display is also average. One thing I would say this phone looks very beautiful and better than Samsung phones of this budget. Overall it's an average phone.
Good battery life and phone charge in 40 mins from 30-100

"I didn't upload pics cause I forgot to take them. I am a one plus user since 2016. I bought one plus 3T when it was launched. That phone is still with me working fine. I am a true one plus fan. So my review on this phone is that it very basic.To be honest I am disappointed with the phone. I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is üëåüèªCons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting. Video get stuck and security and update patch is still not given.If you want to buy a phone for good use and want to use it for a long time. This is okay. But this is no where near to high gaming or photo fan phone"

Overall a decent phone. The camera quality is so bad. This is not Oneplus standard.
"I have ordered this item after doing lot of research for a good phone within my 25k budget. I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget."

Before i had a phone which was more pricey than this but the features which this phone has is awasome no complaints at all when i m getting the best phone in this cool budget why to go costly one who dont even have good camera nor battery life this phone gives me minimum 2 days battery life plus in 1hour phone get charged to 100%

Good battery life .... And other is comparable to oppo or Vivo...Camera is bad
"Camera is average but not as one plus, battery can run more than 1 day with internet uses, here a side finger print on power button that is okay it's good working, facelock is also good because front camera is almost good, one issue that is either you can use one sim card or one memory card either only 2 sim card, means no dual sim with memory, but over all under 20000 ab kya chahiye yaar it's a good phone"

Ordered this mobile with great enthusiasm and it dint let me down the expectations. Overall mobile is good. performance is awesome. Value to money. Only concern is they told it will charge completely in 15mins but it's not the case it takes a bit more than that. Other than that no other concerns about this product.

Battery capacity could have been better with more mah (say 5000 mah and above), but the fast charging is just amazing. About 20 minutes, the battery is completely charged. Look and feel of the phone is nice. OnePlus phones are always charged at a premium price, but I feel the cost can be reduced."
back camera design should be modified like iphone
I love it. Although I'm being told that camera could have been more better for this price range. But it's ok for me.
Phone is work smooth compare to other phone.
Overall Good but Speakers are not Upto the Mark.

Writing after a month of usage. Overall all features are good and nothing negative to write about. Battery lasts a day with average use. Does not hang or slow with multiple apps open.camera is decent . Overall a nice phone for the price
Very nice mobile with excellent battery backup and camera quality
Excellent camera with good looks.previously i used Samsung (25000rs).Now I am very happy with this mobile.only draw back is battery life.it should be 5000mah instead of 4500mah.full chargung with 60w charger will take 45 minutes from 0 to 100

But if you use Tempered glass you will feel a nanosecond lag.AMOLED display(5/5) is amazing and auto-brightness is working fine.Charging(5/5) is just to the next level, 100% charge in 20-25 minutes.Speaker(4/5) is Good, but dual Dolby speakers could be given at this prize.Processor is great, Oxygen OS is running smoothly with android 11 but 12 is needed.Camera is good but could be better at this price.WhatsApp is taking too much storage because it is storing the images and videos in their maximum quality which is not required. In my previous phone, the images were stored in 100-400 kb, but one plus is taking 1.4 - 2 MB for a single image which is toooo much."
Nice
"In this price this phone is good choice. The camera needed little more upgrade but in this price it's good. Everything is smooth and slick. The photos and battery life is good. Nice fast charging, full charge in 20 min to 30 min."
Very good camera and battery backup
"Overall phone is good,but need more baterry life."
Camera quality superb
Ok
Camera quality is best
It is a balanced phone overall but in this price range there are better options than this it is a handy balanced phone with oneplus branding that makes it special. I suggest to buy it in sale or offer.Comparing to options this is not best in the segment.
Excellent

All are good
I have been using from last one month... Within 30 minutes it's getting battery full... Fast refreshing... I have restored all backups from old phone there's no any hang...  Working very well..
best looking phone ever for the price .The quality they maintainedis good .We can extend ram up to 3GB.Pros:1)Looks attractive2)30W fast charging support3) video recording is amazing with best EIS available in the market.4)oneplus nord 2 CE comes with super AMOLED display with maximum of 700 nits brigthness5)Oxygen OS provides the soothing experience for daily usageCons:1)it provides 90 hz refresh rate but 120hz would have been better for the price bracket2)Speakers are not loud3)comes with Lpddr4X ram and ufs 2.2 which makes phone too slow4)No IP ratring provided5)No wireless charging support6) low light photography is too cheapRating:Performance &features : 7/10Display : 6/10Network :8/10Battery backup : 8/10Camera : 5/10Speaker : 7/10Value for money : 7/10
It‚Äôs a good phone in this price range.I am personally not surprised by the UI as I was using POCO X3 earlier‚Ä¶Display could‚Äôve been better.AMOLED from samsung is much superior.Dolby Sound is missing.

"Review on 1st dayThe phone is superb amazing with camera,sound,the famous ""Oxygen Os"" the first day didn't disappoint me although i will write agai after 15 days of usage but till now it's amazing .After 15days- The phone is amazing from top to bottom just that you don't compare cameras to another high price phone i felt the night shits were not that clear but it was bright and day time photos are very fine overall after 15days of continuous usage the phone is solid .

"I am using this phone for over 3 moths now  and it is working perfectly. Camera quality is fine specially night photography. Only thing I wish if they could give a 6k mah battery, right now it is a 4500 mah. The 65W charger is an advantage as it charges from 15 to 100% in 35-40 mins. So if you are in hurry a 15-20 mins charge will do."
"Battery very low, battery down to fast"
"Phone is overall good, but it has stopped fast charging after one month usage.. earlier it used to take 15-20 min for full charge.. but now it takes more than 40 min for a full charge.."
Poor quality

Camera quality good not very good ..
Box doesn't contain ear phone.
"Excellent lower midrange smartphone with nice look and appropriate performance. Ordered for my colleague, he loves it."
I feel the quality of the phone is very good and my expectations are met. I am not a gamer but my requirements of having good fast performing phone for my day today needs. Decent camera and specs they have tried to match the performance. Overall happy.
Overall phone good but there is some features not available.E.g. 1. There is no automatic call recorder function.2. FM üìª not in this phone.3. There is no option how to play music which store in my memory.
Charging time is like beast overall worth it but more will provided by 1 plus so it's more gud  for us
Everything is good.battery life is short other wise good phone at this range

"The Phone is definatly good, but price is a bit high. no doubt its oneplus, and oneplus give a robust hardware which can run upto 3-4 years without any problem.My Criteria -5G - no need till 2023, let 5G network launch first.Charging/battery - 65w charger, best in segment.Proccessor - Mediatek, better if it was Snapdragon. (I compromise)Screen - Amoled.Camera - Not good (feels like I got scam)Features -Camera - camera is not good, it produce whitish pictures, Oneplus please update the software.Battery - Good, with fast chargingDesign - Its very handy phone with standard size.Processor - Its mediatek , better if it was snapdragonOverall - Camera is not good, may be in next software update camera will be fine.you can find better options in market. refer to the criteria above and make your decision."

"Oxygen OS UI is best, and you will feel smooth experience with beautiful display and loud speaker and headphones jack output is crisp and loud...camera need optimization specially in low light ...but the look and feel and light weight of this device will amaze u for sure ...and its good to go with the device with OnePlus brand value."

"Worth of money.. mobile is good for this price whos intrested to used oxygenOS, display litely dull bcz of no AMOLED display and brightness is very low bus 120Hz display so mobile smoothly work..."
When you compare with Samsung M52 with same price tag you feel incomplete for wide range and front camera. The size  could be better if it would be 6.5 inches.Overall handy and lightweight .

Fast charger is blessing. 100% in around 30 mins.On con side,1. phone has connectivity issues specially when using calling over wifi.2. Phone always feels warm. It seems lot of processes running in background. Or may be battery üîã is heating up .. not sure.3. I observed that phone gets warmer if we switch on eye comfort mode.4. Sound quality of speaker is also average.5. Battery life is average too. Lasts a day with very normal use. Not sure how fast it would drain if we play games on it."

Great phone camera could have been better
Best device in this price range
"Product is good. Net surfing is very fast. And camera zooming better in realme, vivo, Samsung this price range."
"I like the phone it's beenmore than 2 months aince I bought it. I have zero complaints about it. And tha camera, battery, sensors, gestures, fingerprint, face recognition almost all features are absolutely amazing wait proper response and working. And being a OnePlus product I guess this phone can run for atleast 4-6 years without any issues if maintained properly. Worth the money"
"It is very good phone in this price range good camera quality, very good finger print reader overall very nice phone i would really recommend this phone"
Perfect mobile
Phone is smooth. Gaming experience is fine.Camera is average. Night mode is below average.Battery drains very fast. Can last only 6-8hrs on continuous run. But has very good fast charging. U can completely charge in 45-60min.
"Good phone. But camera is average like 16000/- phone. Thay given mono speaker, in this price range we can get Dolby on other phone. Any way performance is good. Very fast like blink of your eyes. But much over priced. It should come in 22k to 23k range."
Good mid range mobile but on higher price range
Without using mobile battery decreased
Nice one with the budget
"This is a budget model and a lot of One Plus features are compromised in this model. The camera clarity is bad for the price we pay. Also, this model has some issue with the proximity sensor. One of cousins and I had purchased this phone during the launch offer. But both of us have the same issue with proximity sensor. Even if we lock the phone while in a call, the display turns on automatically with every small movement and will start dialling on it own which will make the listener uncomfortable (listening to the continuous tap on keys). Other than these two, I have not noticed any other issue. But I feel its not a model worthy of 20K"
"Descent phone.Great Design.Batter and charging is very good.Display is awesome,90Hz is perfect.Processor in perfect regarding price.Better 5g connectivity, this phone has 8 5g bands means future protected.Disappointing thing is camera,less than average camera quality, with 24k price cameras should be much better."
Battery charge is not upto mark
Dont buy one plus guys worst phone and the que in the support store will take hours....I bought CE 2 one month prior i got display blotting problem the service centre asked me to pay 6400 though the phone was not damaged.....utterly crap please don't buy one plus ....useless phone no value for money..in case you buy the phone sell it immediately completely useless...and one plus is a problematic brand long ques in service centres of no help....guys please don't buy one plus go for Samsung the trustworthy brand....
"Each and everything about this phone is surprising what was truly more than expected was the charging I literall placed on charge at 9:00 @ 18% battery and after my breakfast @ 9:17 it was 81%, I was shocked and that lasted an ample amount of time in office, have left taking charger to office. Also the night charging is great the phone automatically optimises how fast to charge the mobile so that it reaches 100% at 6 in the morning.Happy till now with the purchase.Though there is a downside I hated the google phone and contact app I am badly missing the stock OnePlus apps, this is OnePlus not some android phone please don't use third party apps just be yourself you are gr8."
"This is an amazing phone for people looking at OnePlus brand to start with. I have previously owned One plus 2 and a One plus 5T and when I had to switch this time, I didn‚Äôt want to move away from OnePlus brand and spend too much money as well. I am a basic smartphone user and use this for basic browsing, social media, YouTube etc and this phone meets the performance bar. If you are looking for a good phone without making compromises on quality of components, camera etc, you can definitely consider this."
Good display quality and fingerprints process is very much for use.

Charge very fast almost full in 40min
"This is one of the best phone in mid range. But don't expect lot, it just doing good performance. I am a regular usage, just few applications so 2 days battery life I am getting. Camera is okay, try different methods to get clear photo. I use sometimes AI off/no, so we can get different clarity. Display is awesome, it support HRD10+. Not sure in Netflix. Slider button is missing, however I was never use the slider button in my OnePlus 3 earlier. I got this phone at 16500 with exchange of my OnePlus 3 and some Amazon coupon. So it's worth to buy with offers."

Previously I used redmi note 4 over 4+ year but when I used OnePlus nore ce 2 5g it's quite bit disappointed me because of not having many more features.Thank you It's absolutely me opinion .
"I wanted to gift a fone to my parents, after a research of almost 20 days I ended up taking 2 mobiles of this Nord 2 5g...1) User friendly interface, specially for elder ones.2) Battery is long lasting3) Fingerprint senser is fast enough.4) The camera is satisfactory.5) Sound quality is wonderful.Overall the fone is worth the money."
Fast charging is very good but span of battery life is not satisfactory...camera quality is good... processor is fast and smooth...
"Overall good budget phone by OnePlus , you will get all the high end features in this.Touch is good.Battery is ok .Camera is not good as compare to samsung same price phone.Little heating but manageable."
Comes with screen protector already applied. Good battery life. A nice phone to buy.
Tip top phone
Camera achha nhi hai
"Mobile hangs when multiple apps are running. Also, the logo is not highlighted as in other OnePlus mobiles, showing their hesitation in showcasing this model in this league. Otherwise good"

"Not a good phone for 22k my phone keeps hanging it takes a long time to open an app, they have kept the finger print on the power button which does recognise your finger with cover or flip, front camera is horrible, when it comes to battery it doesn't long more then 14 hrs and voo charge takes time"

The fingerprint reader is little bit of slow... Otherwise the product is good
In some point there are two same operational app which comes inbuilt with oxigen OS. I am unable to uninstall either one. Also the camera performance is poor not upto the oneplus mark. If possible upgrade camera software to resolve the issues.

Awesome phone from 1+ with this range
"Ordered after comparing samsung M33, lava Agni, redmi and other phones in this range but ordered this one because of brand value and features. Can't think of anything missing in this phone which I might have got in more expensive phones except water proof. Went to store and checked phones physically as well and landed on this one finally. Absolutely no regrets whatsoever ...."
"Camera quality is not upto the mark as 62MP, Not much advanced as expected and it is comparable to Redmi phones of worth 10000-15000/- ‚Çπ maximum. But Phone look is very good. Phone charging speed is really fast within 30-35 min mobile can be 100 percent charge. Overall mobile is ok..but really not the worth of 25000‚Çπ."
The only problem with this mobile is speaker  sound is low . Rest all good. Will write detail review soon.
It help in my job
"Single sound , display quality is not up to mark , performance issue"
Nice product for money.
"The performance and battery life are great but this phone's camera is complete trash, a total let down compared to previous Nords too."

Not just the fast charging that's impressive the battery backup is impressive too! The camera does so good ' the rear camera  has an auto HDR glitch  which i have to turn off everysingle time ! The selfie camera is just fantastic! My device doesn't lag not even a bit' and the features it has everything everysingle features for which OnePlus is known for but yea it misses the alert slider . The screen is well lit iand  the software UI it's an add-on to the beautiful screen .I get good ok network speed on this one . I had a hard time on my past device ...This device is really worth purchase
Nice mobile to use. Battery backup is very good. Display quality is very clear. Need to improve camera quality and Android 12 OS upgrade in future.

After use of 4 month of this phone I conclude that this phn is good at this price range .But it should be better. But sometimes phn feels like hand or slow even at 90hz amoled display. The best part is in 30 min it charges from 0 to 80% with the help of 65wt charger.

Overall a good phone in looks and in-hand feel..only the camera is not up to the mark.. satisfied with it..
Good one worth for money
U can't expect this sort of premiums in the other phones in the same price range. Even if they offer better on paper the in-hand experience and quality are far better. The quality and combination of both software and hardware is awesome and super constructive!
Amazing budget phone
In love with this phone. It is slim and light weight. I had OnePlus 6 before this and this phone is great in terms of camera and features. Overall it's a great good quality phone at this budget.

Ordered with high expectations given my past experience with One Plus but this phone fully disappointed me  Don't feel any major difference between using basic smartphone of 13-17k range and this phone.- battery backup very power unlike other one plus phone- touch is also not very good- proximity sensor doesn't work sometimes- Camera is average
üòç phone and the game changer by OnePlus in mid range. The image quality is far better than any other smartphone in this range.
Battery performance very good
Good product no cons as of now

"Fellow buyers. If you buy this phone, then I request you to not update it immediately.What they do is - At the beginning they will keep the hardware volumes like ringtones, earpiece, speaker, very loud to attract you and not complain about it. Then at next updates these slimes bags will limit the volume at hardware levels, which you will never be able to change in anyway.Please spread this word to everyone."
OnePlus Nord ce2 lite 5G is best Budget phone from OnePlus
Nice Job

Good phone but battery backup needs to be improved. Camera is not worth at price of 24000

Every thing good
Actually it comes with overall positive outcomes and I like this brand so I gave it to full 5/5 to all its services. And in box i have found back cover also but it is not mentioned above. So it's a big pros
Go for 8 gb variant as 4.5 gb ram is always used
Macro camera should be better.

This is an ok ok modelNot soo special one to go for it.The cam is okThe phone gets heated while charging.The phone charges fast.If you are a gamer don't go for this!If you are a mild user of mobile and can afford 20-25k you can try this!!Good luck!!

Performance prospective this device has no issues but when it comes to battery it's draining bit early. Due to 65w charger we can charge it again in faster way.

Finger print reader is very slow.Camera is below average. OnePlus could have provided a better camera at this price range.I feel disappointed in the product.(Views personal)
Camera quality is not much good has 1plus is known. And battery life is less
It troubles you a lot of time with voice assist getting activated. It does not have best of processing unit. Not what i wished...wished i went in for iphone
It's a good budget OnePlus phone. It's slow but has a good screen
"After using 2 months i have a review. Very good phone in this price. Picture  quality is good, camera and sound is osm. Very good experience for purchasing from purchasing through Amazon."

"Good phone but there areSome problems as low proximity sensor, Disappointing Google dialer, low Detailing in camera.Good processor..."
Pros : 1. Its a OnePlus device2. Best connectivity you can have.3. Very sharp camera for outdoor photos.4. Doesn't hang or lags.5. Battery can last upto 1 and half day under normal to heavy usage.6. Charging was never better than this.7. The 3.5mm jack is back.8. Best part is dual sim with expandable memoryCons : 1. Could've given 120Hz refresh rate2. Only decent camera quality under low light.3. Though the speaker is loud but stereo speakers should've been provided.4. Could've come with Android 12

1. Camera quality is just average like 15-19K mobile phone. Doesn't seems like this is oneplus mobile phone camera. I have upgraded from Redmi Note 10 and felt very little improvement in camera.2. Performance is also just okay. I have used oneplus nord 2 which is just 4K expensive than Nord CE 2 but way more faster than this.3. Battery life is great. Charging time is same as mentioned.Overall it is just an okay phone. Nothing special. 4-5K expensive than what is actually offered hence it is overpriced or doesn't justify it's price.
Bettery life is very low one day bhi nahi chalti
Having used for more than 15 days I will say that it is the best budget phone of one plus. Charging is very fast. Smooth functioning of every app.

I think 24000 is too costly otherwise all ok
Everything is fine in this phone but the build quality looks much cheaper and camera quality is worst then 10K phones and genuinely my older phone Realme 5 Pro gives much better picture quality then this phone. Previously I have used OnePlus X too and my experience was very good with that phone that's why I bought OnePlus phone again.

Everything good except sound.  When phone rings. It looks like Chinese phones. Sound is too hard. Of course you can lower down.
Better than other phone

While making call the entire screen/background is going white and was not able to do anything like accessing functions such as turning on speaker phone or even disconnecting. Again the phone only come to live when the other person doesn't answer the call. Even if the other person answer the call there was nothing that we can do
I've been using this phone for 10 days. Everything is decent in this phone but the battery life is not good.I think 25k is a lot for this phone. I personally think I wasted my money as I could get same kind of phone with same features in 15k.

It's my first experience with one plus and has been good till now.  I am not a gamer. But for multimedia and casual photos the experience has been good. In hand field is good and software experience is nice without any bloatware. The Bahamas blue colour is exotic. Well optimised Ram management. Single speaker but is of good quality. Earpiece is loud and clear. Signal quality is good. Carrier aggregation is working fine. Haptic motor is good. Charger is simply amazing. 30 mins full charge. You can go for it provided you are not a hardcore gamer.

I'm using this phone from last five months. This phone model has big issues in dialer.- During call phone gets mute generally.- During a call unwanted beep sound repeatedly comes even when you talk using earphones.- During a call as you open dialer the call gets mute- During conference call if you disconnect someone entire call gets ended.- During conference call when someone has dropped the call the dialer keeps on showing in the active call list.

"If you're planning to buy this CE 2 lite better change your decision to purchase IQOO Z6 or Vivo T1. Previously I was using IQOO Z3 which is far better. I'm not using any heavy gaming or other big apps. Eventhough phone gets hang. Coming to calls, if you dialled by mistake after a ring only you'll get a chance to disconnect. Totally worst outcome of OnePlus."

Product is worth for the cost. However more advance features and battery discharge faster would have considered

Its a good product to buy
Most powerful mobile it's a powerful battery and camera like this Mobile
Phone - ExcellentCamera - ExcellentBattery - GoodNegativeOnly problem with one plus is it's accessory. In case you lost its adapter or cable it's next to impossible to buy the original. Coz from one plus online store it's quite impossible to buy and in one plus stores it's always showing not available. One plus need to improve for availablility of accessories.
"After writing this review my 1 month of usage,, phone look's stunning and performance too good.While using continuously 2 hrs getting heated .If you use more then 20 pic continuously you battery will come down suddenly.Front camera is the one thing one Plus missed completely.Even small budgeted Phone gives more clarity and good picture.but 1+ is ????Finally anyone want to buy 5g phone in budgeted seg. please look samsung"
""
"Right of the box, the look and feel of the phone is amazing. Added to that is the 90hz display that feels crisp and smooth. Camera is a little off the mark when it comes to One Plus standards. It could have better.Overall a good option, when your tight on budget, but want a premium range phone."

"Camera is worst, I bought it through Amazon on 14th Oct and after 2-3 days only there was a white dust kind of layer in camera. All pictures were coming as blurred and pathetic. I got it repaired at service centre again after day same kind of white layer started coming on camera. It's a pathetic handset, please dont buy. You will get better pictures in a 8-10 k budget from any other company like MI, Vivo or Oppo."
good for day to day usage like media consumption and surfing

I like screen refresh rate .Screen is smooth working camera is very good. And real oxygen OS experience in one plus
Hanset is as per expectation. But ringtone is not continues but reduces and increases simultaneously due to which it does not recognise or heard clearly. There is no setting for the same.

Using since 2 days. No hanging issue faced so far and works absolutely smooth (I am not a gamer) . Camera might not be best in this class but still good. Macro camera just average. No bloatware. Almost Pure Android experience. Perfect crisp Display. I find it value for money at this price range.The case provided is of very inferior quality. Start turning yellow at the edges on the very first day. Better they would not have even provided this.PS: Will update my review in case I face any issue.

"Good mobile under best Budget, but camera quality is little down when compare to other OnePlus mobiles. Finger print sensor does not respond some times, and it's quite different from other normal mobile, loud speaker quality is also not satisfactory."
One plus didn't meet our expectation.  Battery drains faster than expected.  Lot of non-core features but VERY handy are not available.  Eg. Would like to see a tiny indicator while charging and the indicator turning green when it's ready.  Setting duration for silent mode turns the silent mode off at the end of the term.Phone calls are clear and so are the picture quality.
Dislike this camera
In this price 1+ mobile is the best choose. Within 15 to 18 minutes battery was charge. More than 27 hours battery work with call video and games. All application is working smoothly with 6GB Memory.

Comparatively Redmi This Mobile was little Expance Except Software Update i will Recomend Redmi This Phone Have some bugs while p[laying games continiously warning images come from system
"Battery is too bad. After buying this phone I am continuously facing some or other problem. Main problem is battery, it drains off very quickly. Today I had full charged around 1 pm. I didnt use phone today and now around 12.30 am my battery is 30%.This is condition on 7th day now imagine what will be condition after 6 months or an year1 more problem I am facing is my head starts paining when I use mobile for few minutes.Big No for this mobile, don't go on one plus name. You will get many better mobiles than this one."
Hang problem
I am using for 4 months now and its camera battery and performance is very good in this budget.
"Using for one month, working very well."
Average product not bad

Nice and good looking mobile and lighting weight also iam happy with this mobile but camera quality average over all good
Same to same as oppo Reno 7

The inbuilt is not that good as compared to previous models because it's manufacturing done in India by oppo. Over all its kinda ok
Looks sturdy comes with stickers and the speed of the phone is good. Good battery life and storage.

Must buy smartphone to use it as a daily driver for the customers having this budget range. Smooth experience & overall satisfied with its performance.
"As a tech geek these are my experiences with this phone..1.Fingerprint scan is not smooth as compare to other low end phone also2. Due to omnivison camera, picture quality is not good in low light.. Okayish camera3. No inbuilt app for messages, dialer, recorder, notes.. All are google based apps4. MAJOR problem- It has google CALL RECORDER by default.. If you record during call ""it will prompt recording has started"" which can be heard to both caller and receiver.. I mean people use Call recorder for safety and secure purpose, but here it is opposite5. If you turn on WiFi hotspot for more than 10 15 minutes,it will start showing heating issue6. After software update, for twice my audio was not working, had to restart again7. Battery drains fast in ambient display mode..8. Did not find any difference in power saving mode aa compare to normal mode.. Battery drains in same speed in both mode..9. I mean its 2022, then why android 11?10..No stereo speakerFew pros :-Look wise its best.. Display is top notch.. Better than Oneplus CE.. 12bands 5g support.. comes with nfc..Few other issues are also there.."
